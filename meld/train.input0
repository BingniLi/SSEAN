also I was the point person on my companys transition from the KL-5 to GR-6 system.
You mustve had your hands full.
That I did. That I did.
So lets talk a little bit about your duties.
My duties?  All right.
Now youll be heading a whole division, so youll have a lot of duties.
I see.
But therell be perhaps 30 people under you so you can dump a certain amount on them.
Good to know.
We can go into detail
No dont I beg of you!
All right then, well have a definite answer for you on Monday, but I think I can say with some confidence, youll fit in well here.
Really?!
Absolutely.  You can relax
But then who? The waitress I went out with last month?
You know? Forget it!
No-no-no-no, no! Who, who were you talking about?
No, I-I-I-I don't, I actually don't know
Ok!
All right, well...
Yeah, sure!
Hey, Mon.
Hey-hey-hey. You wanna hear something that sucks.
Do I ever.
Chris says theyre closing down the bar.
No way!
Yeah, apparently theyre turning it into some kinda coffee place.
Just coffee! Where are we gonna hang out now?
Got me.
Can I get a beer.
Hey, did you pick a roommate?
You betcha!
Is it the Italian guy?
Um-mm, yeah right!
Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica!
What, what, what?!
What?!
He was with her when he wrote this poem.
Look,  'My vessel so empty with nothing inside.
Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.'
He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase!
Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too.
Done.
Hey!
Hi!
What are you doing here?
Ah y'know, this building is on my paper route so I...
Oh.
Hi.
Hi.
Howd did it go?
Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank God Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy and wouldnt shut up.
Im so proud of you.
Me too!
Listen, Im ah, Im sorry Ive been so crazy and jealous and, its just that I like you a lot, so...
I know.
Yeah.

You liked it? You really liked it?
Oh-ho-ho, yeah!
Which part exactly?
The whole thing! Can we go?
Oh no-no-no, give me some specifics.
I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!
Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? Did-did you like that part?
I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.
You fell asleep!!
There was no kangaroo!
They didnt take any of my suggestions!
Thats for coming buddy.
Ill see you later.
Dont go!
Im sorry.
Im so sorry!
Look!
This guy fell asleep!
He fell asleep too!
Be mad at him!
Or, call an ambulance.
Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.
What?! What is with everybody? Its Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day!
Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring.
See, if Im not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity
Okay, thats enough honey!
I dont know.  Let me see the ring.
Great! Okay, here.
All right.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you!  And
What've you been up to?
Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much.
Oh, and in case you were wondering, those are my legs on the new James Bond poster.
Can you hold on a moment? I have another call.  I love her.
I know.
I'm back.
So, are we gonna get together or what?
Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?
Great, I'll see you then.
Ok.  Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.
Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "Hey, you're not Bob."
I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.
Oh my god. You are pure evil.
Ok, pure evil , horny and alone . I've done this
Nobody!
Nobody respects the bucket!
You wouldn't believe what people put in here!
Look!
Okay, does this look like a garbage can to you?
No.
This is my wedding.
All right, yknow what? We really are late! Lets go! Lets go! Lets go!!
Fine. Youll-youll watch it on video when we get back.
Here you go Phoebe! Here you go Phobo! Phewbedo! Phaybobo.

Hey!
Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and Ill have my health insurance back in no time.
Thats great, but shouldnt you be on the toilet right now?
What?!
Whats wrong with you?
Nothing!
Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, havent been able to stand up since.
But um, I dont think its anything serious.
This sounds like a hernia. You have toyou-you go to the doctor!
No way! Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything its gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!
Thats a hernia.
Why did I have to start working out again?  Damn you 15s!
I love your place! Where is this guy from?
Uh thats an eighteenth century Indian artifact from Calcutta.
Oh wow! So, youre more than just dinosaurs.
So much more.
Well, well to sum up, were having fun, you look young.
Okay
But thats not enough. So Soheres a key to my apartment.
Really?!
Really.
You dont think this is too fast.
Get Out!
Ross, can I talk to you for a minute?
Yes, please!  So, what's going on?
Uh, well... Joey and I broke up.
Oh my God, wh-what happened?
Joey is a great guy, but we're just... so different! I mean, during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus!
I knew that was him!
Anyway I just, uh, I think it's for the best.
Hey, you ok?
I guess.
There was hum...  there was another reason that I thought it was time to end it with Joey.
I started to realize that I was having feelings for someone  else.
Ok Geller. Last day of the conference, you know what happens to the keynote speaker.
Oh, professor Clerk we're kind of in the middle of a conversation, here.
Yeah, can you guys just throw him in the pool later?
Or we could throw you both in
Ok, gentlemen!
Please!
Aren't we a little old for this?
I mean, we're scientists, right?
We're academics.
And most importantly I... you-you will have to catch us first.
GO, GO, GO!
Go, go, go!
Oh yeah, now everybody wants to be under this hat!
Oy!!
Whats with all this sand?
Oh, yeah, Bob said there might be flood damage.
Yeah, either that, or he has a really big cat.
Okay, see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna bash his head in later.
Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.
If you said, "Big lima bean, bubbling up." Would she understand the difference?
Rach? What are you doing?
Oh boy, I just can't watch. It's too scary!
It's a diaper commercial.
Oh yeah well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh!!!
Pizza delivery!
I'll get it! I will get that!
Hi!
Hi!
Hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh?
Uhh, the ball thing.
Yeah?
Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?!
Uhh,
Okay!
Uh-oh.
What?
I have to pee. And Rachel's in the bathroom!
Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it!
I know!  Don't switch hands, okay?
Hey.
Hey!
How did it go with Erin?
Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!
Yay!! Oh so, youre not, youre not mad at us anymore?
No!
No!
No!
You guys were totally right!
This is so much better than the first time we went out.
Yknow?
That was so awkward, we were really nervous.
Didnt you sleep together?
Yeah, that really calms me down.
And!
We have so much in common!
She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if we were ever to have kids, well thats a
Oh my God! Listen to you talkin about having kids. Oh my Joey.  Oh, please dont get married before I do.
Okay.
How does she do that?
I cannot sleep in a public place.
Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.
Oh! What what what! ...Hi.
It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again.
What's going on with you?
I got no sleep last night!
Why?
My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed.
Oh, and deaf.
So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time.
You have no idea how loud they are!
Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.
Thanks.
Ew! What is that? Something exploded!
It's just her water breaking. Calm down, will you?
Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?
Breathe, breathe, breathe.
Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, hes actually going to kill you dead.
Okay! You dont think I thought of that?
How can you not know which one?
I mean thats unbelievable.
I mean, was it Gina?
Which one is Gina?
Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings.
No, no, no, thats Dina.
You see you cant tell which one is which either, dwha!!
I dont know, you thought See you Saturday was funny.
Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with.
You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.
Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.
Really!?
Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out.
I mean for, for all you know I could be a fashion..... monger.
Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me.  What?

No, Im good.
Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?
Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so
Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition?
Who knows?
Okay uh, we have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle, and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much.
Yes!! I knew it!!  Bye-bye! So long! Later!
Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!
Yeah!
Actually, that can't happen.
Yeah because you all have such different looks, we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben.
So it'll be either you two  or you two.
Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.
Yeah, it is.
No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird.
Okay, come on, I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.
Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay!  Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.
Please!

I think youve got concussion.
No, no, Im serious. Thank you.
Youre welcome.  Im sorry. Did I hurt you?
Its worth the pain.  Yknow what, you know what? Its not.
Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David.
I do! Want a hint? huh? "I do"  "I do".
Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee.
David is going to propose to Phoebe.
What?  Why?
Chandler, we have talked about this.
You are not supposed to give people advice!
Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?
I
They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike!
She'll say "No", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone
Man, that's some
Oh, that's not what you want...
This is my father, Paul Stevens. Dad, this is Ross Geller.
It-its great to meet you Paul.

I have a question about this scene.
Yes?
Well, I dont understand why Adriennes attracted to Victor.

Oh, hey, how about this one.
Ah, its says so in the script!
Y'know ah, I-I dont know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that youre a bitch.

Sure. So how long you been...
Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships?
Since then?!
No, it's only been six years.
I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy.
...Joe.
Y'ever been in love?
...I d'know.
Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes.
You're one to talk.
Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women.
Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.
Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you.
Everythings gonna be all right. Okay, Dick?
Hello, I am Guru Saj--Whoa!!  Thats supposed to be a duck right? Cause otherwise, this is waaay out of my league.
Hey, Rach, how was work?
Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasnt a chair.
By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.
Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming.
Im just gonna throw it out, its probably just a bunch of shampoo and...
Something wrong?
No. Nothing.
And then, and then you said that thing about, about bringing the Mesozoic era in the 21st century.
Yeah, that's it?
Yeah.
Dude, I am sorry about what I said!
No, no, youre right, it is a ridiculous name!
Its not that bad.

You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?
It's gonna be worth it.
It's a known fact that women love babies, all right?
Women love guys who love babies.

What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you?
Well, we are great guys.
Bye.
Well, not really.
I mean technically its-its not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon.
Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.
Well Ross, you be careful now. You dont want to get a reputation as yknow Professor McNailshisstudents.
Yeah. What-what should I do?
Well Ross, it seems pretty clear.
I mean whats more important?
What people think or how you feel, huh?
Ross, you gotta follow your heart.
Joey that is so sweet.

Thats right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit filmthat Batman film he was in.
You cant wear that! Im wearing the famous tux! James Bonds tux!
So?
SoIf you wear that youll make mine less special.
Sorry, I just dont like the idea of when I say "I do," hes thinking, "Yeah, Id do her too!"
Well then we still have a problem.
Yeah!
With what?
Well, were trying to find someone to perform our wedding and theyre all either boring or annoying or yknow, cant stop staring at the ladies.
Oo! You should have one of us do it!
Phoebe, were getting
No! No! Its-its uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained on the Internet and perform like weddings and stuff!
I call it!!
What?! No! It was my idea!
Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!
We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!
See, I see.... big passion in your future.
Really?
I do.
Oh Ross, you're so great. [she playfully rubs his head and gets up]
That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why.
Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldnt sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions.
Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over.
Yeah, I wouldve except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side.
What?!?!
Okay, this is what Im talking about, this. I-I need to live in a land where people can spill.
You can spill. In the sink.
Aw, honey its not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I dont see that happening.
I love you, too.
Aww, good.  What?
What? Im just said.
No youre not, youre wondering which cushion it is.
Oh my God! Are you serious?!
Uh-huh.
I would love to live with you Ross.. thats-thats great! Thank you!
Well, Im-Im just glad I could, yknow, help you out.
Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me!
I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless.
You just saved me!
Youre my hero!
Hero, I uh, I dont knowwell, all right.
Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has!
Oh please!   Youre gonna say things now, arent ya?
No.
No, I wont.
But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise.
She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didnt love her, but he really did, and it just blew up!
...Dammit, hire the girl!  Okay, everybody ready?
Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.
Lose the robe.
Me?
That's great.
Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?
No, no, I'm still working on mine.
That's it?
Yeah, it was really hard.
Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.
Ok, you weren't there.
Wow! Thats ah, thats pretty nice!
Pretty nice?
Youll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.
We dont have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it? Weve got a canoe.
Y'know, I, I really dont think we need a canoe.
You gotta take the canoe!
All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!
Were not throwing it away! I built that canoe!
Good for you!!
Pheebs?
Yeah?
Okay. Then I guess its just, wait here then.   Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.
One ticket to Yemen?
Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.
Im sorry sir, I dont understand.
What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
Are you travelling with a child?
No.
All right, yknow what, shes  gonna think that Im handing you a credit card, but what Im really gonna do is hand you a library card.
Okay, but this is the last time.
With a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there.
Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick--chickeeeen.
Hey.
Hey.
Hows she doing?
She?
Well yeah, dont-dont you think its a she?
I dont know.  I cant tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly.
Well, anyway, I got to go change, Im ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks.
Excuse me?
What?
Okay, good, so there you go. Go with Vince.
Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive.
Well sensitive is important, pick him.
Yeah.
Oh sure, go with the sissy.
Jason is not a sissy!
Oh no-no-no-no, I meant Chandler.
Hi.
So uh, apparently people are familiar with the Europe story?
Yeah.
Listen about that, the whole uh, who came on to who thing really doesnt matter.
I mean, I think it wouldve happened either way.
I mean if you hadnt initiated it I-I-I know I wouldve.
It was an amazing night.
It was. It was an amazing night.
You think it looked amazing?
Do we have a name yet?
No, not yet.
Thats fine, for now well just call her Baby Girl Green.
Oh no, Baby Girl Geller-Green.
Hello baby girl.
Ah-ha, nowhere to run!
I dont like sitting up here! Im just gonna over
No Rachel! They got here first!
Why is Ross doing that?
DANGER
Oh my God! Why is he jumping on those women!
No thats all right. Dont worry about it.
Oh but look! Thats gonna leave a stain!
Rach! Hey! Its fine! Youre at Joeys!
Really?
Yeah! Look!
Ive never lived like this before.
I know.
All right, dont waste it, I mean its still food.
Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity?
I don't know, but one of the extras sure did!  Hey, listen    Rach. Thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes!
Oh, please!Honey, just the fact that you want me here to support    you, I'm...OH MY GOD!Is that Christian Sanders?He's so
Also so
Oh, in my head he's done some pretty "not-gay-stuff"!
Well, at the Christmas party him and Santa did some definitely    gay stuff!
OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you.
About what?
He's planning your birthday party.
Oh my God! I love him!
You'd better act surprised.
About what?
My surprise party!
What surprise party?
Oh stop it. Joey already told me.
Well, he didn't tell me.
Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing.
This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.
No, you are not. We tell you stuff.
Yuh-huh!
I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo.
I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in.
Looks like I was second to last.
Chandler, we still havent gotten an RSVP from your dad.
Oh! Right. Umm, maybe thats because I didnt send him an invitation.
Chandler! Hes your father.  he should be at the wedding.
I dont even know the man. Okay? Were not that close. I havent seen him in years.
Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasnt even asked?!
Its not like we run in the same circles.
I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.
Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles.
Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.
So what! As long as hes not wearing a white dress and a veil I dont care.
Okay, I think I need to do some shopping.
Hello! Whos in there?
How ya doin?
Who in the hell are you?
I guess you wouldnt believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?
No-no, Rachel, dont get it! He cant see us!
No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!
Im not gonna marry Chandler!
Not after this!
Okay, you guys, just relax.  I doooo.
I gotta go.
Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua!   Yeah, well, that oughta do it.
Sorry I'm late, but I left late.
Okay.
So Pheebs, what is the book about?
I thought you said you read it in high school.
Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anywayumm, what is this book about?
Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those?
Y'know what, actually  Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?
I thought you didn't smoke.
Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know?
Y'know what I mean, like dubbies?
And I actually, I thought to myself, "Wow, those guys are crazy!"
But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.
We get high.
Oh, me too.
I'm kidding.
Oh, me too.
Oh, are you sure you're ok?
Yeah.
Does it still hurt?
Yeah.
What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm gonna do this.
Hi.
Hey, how'd it go?
Excellent.
We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.
What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way.
You know what? You are right. I
Good for you Pheebs!
Ok.
Okay  If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean
This sucks! I didnt know I had to stay up all night before I went to this stupid sleep clinic! Im so tired!
Its 6:00.
Hi!
Yeah, Rach, I think youre handling that really well.
Handling it?
What do you mean, handling it?
Theres nothing to handle.
Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasnt for me and Joshua.
Yknow, theyre not gonna get married anyway!
What?
Come on!
They rushed into this thing so fast its ridiculous!
And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realise what theyve done and theyre call the whole thing off.
Im telling ya, youre gonna be dancing at my wedding before youre dancing at theres.
What the hell is this?!
What, did you actually thought it would make me feel better to give me stuff that I cant use for another two months?!
This sucks!
All right, whats my next present?
All right, theres a nuclear holocaust, Im the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?
Enhh
Ive got canned goods.

Excellent hole, Joe.
Oh no! No!! My hole!!

That you enjoyed the occasional drinking binge.
Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! Im leaving! You are just a horrible person!
Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!!
If youre gonna get all sensitive about it!
I dont want to lose you.
What if I, create a position for you?
Ill make you an assistant buyer in this department.
Say more things like that.
You can have your own office, and a raise! Effective tomorrow.
Id need an expense account.
Done!
And an assistant.
Sophie, get in here!
Monica? You gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.
Oh my!
They're male nurses.
Not in my head.
Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?
Umm.  Umm. Umm. I don't think so.
What?
What are you talking about?!
You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on.
I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me.
Come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go.
Umm, why don't you give

Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?
Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some

Thank you.
Okay. Lets bring it in.

That almost hit me in the face.
Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.
Hey!
Hey!
Yknow Im-Im really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
Oh boy, me too!
Yknow I was thinking if we had aa big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours
Yeah?
Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!
The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!
Thats me! Come on!
Okay.  But wait, we cant. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, were supposed to have lunch.
Well, get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.
Shrill?! The wedding is back on!
I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.
Hi! Nice to meet you!
Nice to meet you too.
So, are you ready to go?
Yeah.
Chandler!
Ill be right with you.
Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple.
Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple.
You can take it off.
Just slice that baby right off!
Take your shirt off, and let's see what we're dealing with here.  What are you doing?
Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.
Well that's not a third nipple.

First of all, it's on your ass.
Well then, what is it?!
Wait a minute, hold it.  Johnson! Will you come in here a moment?

Just tell me how.
Uh-oh, I feel another one coming.
Let it go, Ross.
Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi.
Do you all promise?
Chandler? Do you promise to be good?
You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!

Honey, both yours.
Hey! Great advice on that Joey thing!

What problem did you tell him you had?
Oh thats not important. The point is, I reallyI think everythings gonna be okay.
Okay, Ive got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?
No thanks, Mom!
Ha-ha, its not my baby, ha-ha-ha!
Very good,  so good.
I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.
Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didnt call.
I mean youd think hed be worried about me not showing up at his club.
Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!
Come on! Look where you are!!
When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris.
Remember, a virgin for me please.
Oh! And dont let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.
Ahh, come on! Yknow whatyknow what, I think Im just gonna go home and call Kathy.
Well, if you think it will help.
No!
That was a test!
In a couple of hours Im gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me!
And then after that, Im gonna get so drunk, Im gonna wanna call Janice
You should! How is she?
Ohhh!!
I think somebody needs another lap dance.
All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.
You do?
You dont?  Well, thats the difference between a professional and a layman.
That and arrogance.
Hey.
Hey! How was sailing?
Wow thanks!
Joe?
Yeah!
Uh, youve had a lot of sex right?
When? Today? Some, not a lot.
Well, its just the reason that Im asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable toI mean I really wanted to, but I couldnt.
There huhhmm, there-there was an incident.
Dont worry about that man, that happens.
Its happened to you?
Yeah! Once.
Well, whatd you do?
I did it anyway.
Sup? Sup dude?
Take whatever you want, just please dont hurt me.
So youre playing a little
Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.
Come on man, really how old?!
Young! Youre a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybodys ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!
And they knew about it?
Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?
Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!
Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just dont know what the big deal is!
The big deal is I dont want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzlebeer! Cold beer.
Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?
Do you always have to bring him here?
I didn't wanna leave him alone.
Alright?
We- we had our first fight this morning.
I think it has to do with my working late.
I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...
Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.
Oh, that'd be great!
Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.
Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.
Check this out.
It says here that theres a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums!
"Its almost as good as being there."
Its better! You cant go to a museum in your underwear!
Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!
Uh, may I help you?
Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, Im the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed.
Look, its like I told you, theres nothing I can do. You signed for it, Monica Velula Geller.
All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king.
Nobody sees the king!
Oh-ho-kay, Im talking to the king.
Hey! You cant go back there!
Oh my God.
So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh?
I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, dont have to sell those cookies anymore.
Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a
Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?
Yeah.
My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, hed be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal.
I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.
No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says hes gonna double the college money my Grandma left me.
Oh, um, I dont know if thats a good idea.
Oh. Look, just friends, I wont grope you. I promise.
No, I just I think that its too soon.
No its not too soon, I had lunch at a eleven.
I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
And now you want that money back.
Exactly.
Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?
Its not a real game! I made it up!
Im sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.
I don't know.
But I can see through your sheet.
Yeah, yeah, that's her.
But y'know what?
Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway.
Why?
Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.
What are you talking about?  She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!
No. No. No. She lives on the
No, those first two windows,  that's the lobby.
And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway.
You've been counting wrong.
I did
Monica, betting the apartment, I dont know about this.
Rachel, I have not missed one question the whole game. I own this game! Look at my hand.
Why? Do you have the answers written on there?
No! Steady as a rock! Now, are you with me.
All right, lets do it.
All right, gentlemen, youre up first.
Okay.
Okay.
You have 30 seconds. And the lightning round beginsstop it now. What was Monicas nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?
Big fat goalie.
Correct. Rachel claims
Dangerous Liaisons
Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...
Weekend at Bernies
Well, look, why dont you just, why dont you do your Phase Two strip club thing with us.
Yeah, come on, we can be guys!
No you cant.
You dont want to be guys, youd be all hairy and wouldnt live as long.
Yknow you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!
Okay.
Im sorry.
And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year Ive only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio.
You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.
Well, that shouldnt be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men.
Pete, can I get you something else?
Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if youre given em out.
Havent you and I covered that topic?
Hmm, come on, you just said to her that you.
Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.
Well, if that were true, Id dating my Aunt Ruth.
And the two times we went out were just plain awkward.
Come on, you think she should go out with me, dont you?
Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her?
I mean that aint a pretty picture in the morning, yknow what I mean.
That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know.
I mean really, think about it.
Ho-ho, I will.
I believe I read that somewhere!
That only is not funny, it's physically impossible!
Okay?
Depending    on the species I'd have to have a six foot long...
It's not funny!
I respectfully disagree.
I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!
Who cares? Nobody reads those things
You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your    page today.
I don't have a page.
Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!
I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you. Bye.
Okay, what is in here? Rocks?
No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.
So, rocks.
I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there.
Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing  and it kinda knocked me out a little?
I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.
Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?
Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice
You
Why?
Hey, you guys! Look what I found in the giiiiiiift shop.  Get up! Get up! Get up!

Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra.
Ohh, its time to go.
Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clocks a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes.
Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes?

Hi, here's the deal.
We lost a carseat on a bus today.

My name is Ross Geller.
I'm one of the people who applied for the apartment.
And I-I realize that the competition is fierce butI'm sorry.
I, I can't help but notice you're naked and  I applaud you.
Man, I wish I was naked.
I mean, this-this looks so great.
That is how God intended it.
Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship!
But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him!
Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest!
Okay, you go!
My turn? What-what are you talking about?
Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.

I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, "I'll just tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours."
And he said, "Laundry?

Somebody went to college. Wow.  What is it? Im sorry.
Okay, I hear you loud and clear. Bob will stay put.
I think its best sir.
But we really do need to find someone up here.
The work is starting to pile up.
Ive got a stack of documents on my desk this high.
Yknow what you should do, just toss em in the shedder and claim you never got em.
Thats a good one.
What does a guy have to
Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico.
Hi, Julie!

Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights.

That's
Hey, I've been honing!
What was with the dishes?
Oh, uh..
I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know?
I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.
Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!
Oh my God!  Go away!  Stop looking in here!
Great, now he's waving back.
Man, we gotta do something about that guy.
This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment.
It creeps me out!
I feel like I can't do stuff!
What kinda stuff?
Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.
You cook naked?
Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.
What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.
Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.
Its just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasnt called. Not that I even care, y'know.
Phoebe why dont you just call her? You obviously want to.
You think you know me so well.
Well, dont cha wanna?
Yeah.
Okay, well I do know you.
Thats what I said.
Well so?
I cant.
I cant.
She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was Okay, bye Pheebs gone.
Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun Ive ever had in like all my lives.
Ok, bye.  Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.
Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?
It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.
Nuh-uh.
Yuh-huh.
So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?
Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear.
This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwearyou want it to be dirty?
No.
Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?
Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my
Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?
That's the rule.
What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!
How'd you get to that?
Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio
You knew about that?
Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.
Ok, ok, How about if we split it?
What do you mean, like, buy it together?
Yeah
You think we're ready for something like that?
Why not?
Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?
Why, are you moving out?
I'm not moving out.
You'd tell me if you were moving out right
Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...
Aw, I know all about Kip!
It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.
Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?
Aw, don't do that
Ooh, oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment.

Yknow this is actually not a great time for me.
Okay! So, well just stay married.
Yes, exactly!
And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!
Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought Id have to talk you into this more.
What-wh-what so well just stay married forever?!
Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you?
Really?
I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.!
Its
Ohh, okay, Im sorry.
Youre right.
Yknow what?
Im asking you to do me a favor.
You are asking me to be your wife!
And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.
Oh my God!
I know, I know, I'm such an idiot.
My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?
Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her-
-leg?
That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch.
You actually broke her watch?
Barry, I'm sorry...
I am so sorry...
I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju-  Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...

Sometime?

Cause every time I see your face, I cant help but fall from grace. I know.....
Wow! This girl is good.
Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before.
I like her.
Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?
Well, thats pretty much all Im looking for from these people.
Look at you. All jealous.
Yeah Pheebs, come on, you two have completely different styles. Y'know, shes more.. y'know, and youre more

Umm, he said he thought I was funny.
So Okay, look-look umm, let's just go downstairs, we'll have some fun, and you will forget all about it.
Ross, no! There is
Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad.

And besides, hey-hey-hey no one is even gonna

Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!
You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade?
So?!
Whoa, ah!! Were you just gonna give me some lemonade?
Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up!
Oh right, right.
I dont believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex?
Well usually...yeah!
Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice.
Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me.
Im such a jerk.
Its okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it.
Hmmm... this is so nice.
OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
OK.
OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
Ohhh!!!!
Yes, yes, that's right...
Oh, look at the little cat!
What?  Ow!

I didn't mean
It's brilliant!

Thank you, Chandler.
Sincerely.
Well, you're welcome! Glad I could help.

We are switching at the next rest stop and
All right. All right.
Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radios broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.
Really? I dont
Sing!!
Morning!
Everything was delicious!
Thank you!
It was. The duck in particular was superb.
Thank you!    You haven't said anything...
Actually I do have one small complaint.
Oh..please!I-I welcome criticism.
The musician right outside the restaurant...it's kind    of a mood-killer!
What musician?
We did?
You owe me 20 bucks.
Thank you. Thank you so much!
Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.
Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner?
What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?
All right, I'm nine years old.
Oh, I hate this story.
We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner.
I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.
Oh my god.
Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
Hey, who's this little naked guy?
That little naked guy would be me.
Aww, look at the little thing.
Who are those people?
Got me.
Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle.  'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.
Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
Looks like a fun gang.
Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!
So, whats this about?
Rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm, I believe that this is your red sweater.
No.  This is my red sweater.
Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee orpoison? No? Just for me? Okay.
Whats going on Rach?
Nothing! Phoebe kinda made a mistake. But yknow you do wear that sweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of dare?
Yknow, Im actually glad Phoebe called.
I know we broke up because you thought I wasnt mature enough, but Ive really grown up and think we should get back together.
Oh, its just not the right time.
It is the right time.

Oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid    of us??
Yeah...
And last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times    restaurant?
Yeah...
OH! And the year before that, when you set up that nighttime    tour of that button factory?
Who's this from?
Oh, that's Ross's.
Oh...  Oh my God. He remembered.
Remembered what?
It was like months ago.
We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl.
Oh!
I can't believe he remembered!
Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
I can't believe he did this.
Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
What did you just say?
F-hah.... flennin....
Oh.... my God.
I really like waking up with you.
I like waking up with you too.  Oh! It's such a beautiful morning.  Oh, I can stay here all day.

Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
Youre right, youre right I shouldnt freak out.
Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies!
When will that be?
Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!
Hey Ross! The babys kicking!
What?! It is?!
Its not kicking right now. Although we would love to see you do  that again.
Hey, when-when was it kicking? What happened?
Last night! I just felt it and I went into Joeys room and he was sleeping
A dreamless sleep.
So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt!
Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar!
Alright. Let's talk reality for a second.
Okay.
When are you coming home?
What? Guys, I'm not.
C'mon, this is us.
I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job-
Waitressing?
Okay, I'm not just waitressing.
I'm..
I, um...
I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh...
I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies.
We get off around midnight, why don't we pick you up then?
So, um, will you bring the truck?
I'll even let you ring the bell.
Oh, my god.
See, there you go, the cleansing works!
They're nice guys.
Oh, they're firemen guys.
Your son.
No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie.
Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to Jordie.
What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean,
Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp.
I got it.
I got it.
I got it! Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps.
No, you don't.
All right, that's it. I want both of you out.
Why?
He started it!
No, you started it.
I don't care. I am trying to get a person out of my body here, and you're not making it any easier.
Now go!
Thanks a lot.
See what you did.
Yeah, listen...
Out
Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?  Why? What did I say?
Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight.
Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.
Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi.
Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times.
You didnt say Boutros Boutros Gali.
Boutros Boutros Gali.
He says he was too.
Interesting.
So I was wondering....
Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit.
Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun.
So you're a chef?
Im also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.
Oh, really.
Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please.  What are you doing?
Well, I was having a conversation.
Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I havent been able to say two words to each other.
What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?
That would be great. Thank you.
so we finally get to the top of the mountain and airhead here  forgets the camera!
Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.
When did that happen to you?!
Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a pictureI didn't have my camera!
Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.
Oh, this is so good  you have got to try it.
Oh, damn! I got it on my pants.
Here, I'll get it.
We'd better take these pants off upstairs or that stain's gonna set.
Yep.  I'm gonna wear these on our date tonight.
Oh, great!
Okay, bye!  Oh my God!!
That was unbelievable!
Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.
I don't believe they're brother and sister.
They're brother and sister!!!
Action!
I found the picture!
What picture?!
The picture of my wife! In your pack!
You went through my personal property?
Why do have a picture of Paulette in your pack?!
Because Vincent, we were lovers.  For two years!
Cut! Wonderful!
Great scene yeah?
Oh youre awesome! And, in that last speech? You soaked me.
Heres your call sheet for tomorrow.
I know.
So Chandler, your parents mustve been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.
Oh yeah, I should probably call them.
I remember when we first got engaged.
Oh, I dont think I ever heard that story.
Well, Id gotten Judy pregnant. I still dont know how that happened.
You dont know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!
What a sweet story.
Well, at least youre not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party.
What?! They wanted a scary story!
Anyway, were really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon well be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund.
What?
You tell her Jack, I cant do it.
What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund dont you?
We have it. Only now, we call it the beach house.
After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,
Did that!
Grasp one of the linen strips by its easy grab tab and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.
Okay.  Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
Was it not pain-free?
No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.
Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial dont seem to think its that bad.
Thats because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid.
But hey, y'know if you dont believe me, please, by my guest.
Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!
Now umm, remember Im still learning.
One, two, three, four!
You know the song! Sing along!
So?
No!
Oh my God! Thats David!
David who?
David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart David!
Oh my God!
Oh, you say someones name enough, they turn around.
Phoebe?
David!  What-what are you doing here? Arent you supposed to be in Russia?
Yeah, Im just, Im just in town for a conference. Umm,
Well Yeah. You look great too. Did you get a haircut?
Yeah. Well I-I got like thirty of them.

But hey, its not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides
Whatever.
Okay, Mon, back me up here.
Where you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right?
And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?
I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.
Look, Ross, really its-its no big deal.
Yknow you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we cant be friends at work, then so be it.
Yknow, hey I understand.
Yknow?
Hey, when Im in a play and youre in the audience, I dont talk to you, right?
So its yknow, its uh, its cool.
Ill see you tomorrow.
Yeah, when were in the audience he doesnt talk to us, but he does wave.
You did look like an idiot.
Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot.
All right?
Remember when Ross tried to say, "Butternut squash?"
And it came out, "Squatternut buash?"
Yeah that's the same.
That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving.
Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even know that happened. So which one was it?
Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.
Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about.
Y'know, for me anyway.
And of course, the Indians.
Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!
Hi, guys.

Oh well, give it time.
So the divorce, the marriage, weve got a lot to celebrate.
How about we all go out to dinner tomorrow night?
Tomorrow night it is then, I should be out of court by six.
They keep throwing these sexual harassment cases at me and I keep knocking them out of the park!
Okay, Ill see you tomorrow!
Just so you know, were not seeing him tomorrow.
I-I cannot spend another evening with that man.
Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?

And-and I promise, I won't touch a guitar until you say I'm ready.
You really think I'm ready?
Uh-huh!
Wow! Cool!

Well, this has been fun.
Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.
Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout.  See ya.
Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457.
And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.
Were beginning to see a lot of layering of sheer fabrics and colours. For instance a sheer navy blouse over a pink....
Im really glad we came.  Youre so pretty. I love you.
Okay, thats a fire. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
Excuse me, Im sorry, Im gonna have to call you back, Ive got a Schemp in my office.
What are you doing?

But ah, hey, oh, somebodys off the phone, how bout a glass of wine by the fire, I could get it going again.
Ross youre not listening to me, I dont have time to stop.

Good bye!
Actually, thats our three hole punch.
Oh yeah? When?
I'll tell you what.
When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
No, no, no.
What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
Uh, uh.
Well?
Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack!
Hey.
Hey. Ooh, look at you, dressy-dress.
Did you go home and change?
Yeah, well, it's an important day. I wanna look nice. Um, has uh Dr. Franzblau been by?
No, I haven't seen him.
Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here.  What if the baby needs him?
Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor?
Yeah, why?
No reason.
I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to wish you  a Merry Christmas!
What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?
Yes! Yes! Please, just give it to me!
Yeah, thats her.
Thank you.
Its unbelievable! I-I cant believe that sign didnt work!
Yknow what would work?
Stop making candy!
You mean they like you.
Maybe.
Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man?
We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled CUT!
Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?
Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit.  Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!
Cos I was gonna say theres no way you couldve done the end the way you guys did it back then!
What? We could do it!
I dont know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then.
I can do it, okay? Come on, lets go.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
I cant do it!
Now you do that, youre on TV.
Hey!
So, what are you guys in the market for? Weve got uh, scarves, tulip post cards...
Check this out? Huh?  Yeah. Thats the stuff. What do you think?
Well, I dont have to buy that, "Im with stupid" T-shirt anymore.
Well, I like it. Here you go.
All right, look, youre not really gonna buy that are you? Dont you think youve embarrassed me enough for one day?
Oh, I embarrass you?
How can I answer that when Im pretending I dont know you?
Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?
Theyre all tourists.
All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, yknow, youre gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.
Oh yeah?  If youre gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.
Good choice.
Thanks.
Okay, wait. All right, thats it, okay, Im out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore!
So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?
What?
Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else.
And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You don't even know me...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you.
What?
The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that you would think this.
I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe...
No, it's about all women. Well, all American women. You feel better now?
Oh yeah.
Okay, forward. ForwardStop!  Okay, backStop!  Okay, forwardStop! Stop! Stop!
Okay, heres what were gonna do.
Okay, Im gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral.
You guys push it forward so Ross can drive out of his spot.
Okay?
All right, here we go.
Haul ass!!!
So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain.
So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...
...and live forever as a machine!
That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now?
You and I, we're interfacing.
Yeah, I gotta go.
Ba dum bumb cheshhh!
David, can you help me?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air.
Oh, certainly. That's a combination of Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law of motion.
See?
Yeah, that's the same as "it has something to do with wind".
Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.
Oh, I should go, too.
Oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there.
Oh... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there.
And she was like "Oh, don't worry!
I asked him.
He's totally ok with seeing you!".
So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him!
Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!
Exactly!
And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!
I didn't even think about that!  Aaargh,
Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something.
Ok, that'll be great!
Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.
That's not what we're gonna do!
Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?
Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me.
Hello Skidmark.
Its a nickname, Ill explain later.
Its pretty clear.
Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.
Thats why you broke up with me?
You-you-you didnt know that.  Well, I guess my work here is done!
Ni-chou chi-ma!
Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me....
Hi everyone.
I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh, our little talk before.
Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.
What did, what did he say?
Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know.
So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so.
Oh, great!
We couldnt keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while yknow, hed kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck.
Okay, stop it Phoebe, youre getting me all tingly.
All I could think of was yknow, "Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?"
And did he?
Im a lady Monica, I dont kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself.
Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.
I just like him so much that I just feel like Ive had 10 drinks today and Ive only had six.
Oh, I havent had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler.
Wow, Im never gonna have that feeling again, am I?
You sound like a guy.
No, a guy would be saying, "Im never gonna get to sleep with anyone else."
Oh my God!
Im never gonna get to sleep with anyone else!
Ive been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that Id be giving up!
I mean, IIm never gonna have a first kiss again.
Youll have a last kiss.
Thank you so much for coming back over.
Oh good, youre here. Yeah, and I was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable.
I know Mona, just hear me out.
First of all, Im so sorry about my father yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own.
Youre gonna have to tell me how you did that.
Focus.
Okay. UmButOkay, yes Ross and I used to date. And yes we are gonna have a baby. But we are
All right wheres that turkey!
Joey! Those are my maternity pants!
Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!
No.
No!
Oh, would you look at that Monica?
I just knocked off all of your top scores, how sad.
Okay, Im next.  Dont! Dont start another game! I said Im next! Phoebe!
Oh, Im sorry. I didnt hear you over all the winning.
Chandler! Phoebes hogging the game!
Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?
Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.
Anyway, it just doesnt seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? Its a lot of work.
But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving!
I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie!
Or Friday with no two pizzas!
All right fine! If it means that much to you! But justtheres gonna be a ton left over.
No there wont! I promise I will finish that turkey!
All right, youre telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?
Thats right!
Cause Im a Tribbiani!
And this is what we do!
We can eat!
Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.
Look at this!
Oh! You have a window!
Yes indeedy!  With a beautiful view of...
Oh look! That guy's peeing!
Hi.
Hi.
Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please, help me with this too?
Okay. Lets use this brush.
Okay. This stuff?
Yeah.
All right.
Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid. Okay? Just sweep it.
Okay-Dokey
Where exactly is your zoo?
Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience.
Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?
Yes.
Does he, uh, fight with other animals?
No-no, he's, he's very docile.
Even if he were... cornered?
Well I, I don't know. Why?
Uh, how is he at handling small objects?
He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...
How about a hammer, or a small blade?
Otherwise it's just cruel.
He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.
We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...
...He's in.
He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!
You're making a big mistake here.
I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains.
My specimen is in the    room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there.
Really helped speed the process along!
Janice!
You're not... gone?
Sid is still in his room.
I don't allow porn at home so    this is like a vacation for him.
So did you do it?
Did you make your deposit?
Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!
That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes    next, I mean aren't you worried about the results?
I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet...    I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.
Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is.
Phoebe, where's your purse?
No, no! Give it to me!
You can't have it.
Give it to me!
No
I'll go in there.
Oh yeah.
Phoebe come here
Haha!
Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!
What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial.
I just had sex.
Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?
Well, you never told me how old you were.
Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?
I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'...
Don't say it.
...in love with you.
Really?
Sorry.
Well,fall out of it.
You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night.
Oh god, oh god.
I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad.
I'm Joan Collins.
Who?
Thats right, still no baby!  Come on people! Please make some room!
Uh sweetie, maybe youd be more comfortable here?
You. Like you havent done enough.
Look, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do.
I mean I wish I were a seahorse.
Because with seahorses its the male, they carry the babies.
And then also umm, Id be far away in the sea.
God.  I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!
Oh I know, Ive been there. I remember toward the end
Oh Phoebe, thats a great story.
Can you tell it to me when youre getting me some iced tea?
Oh God, get out!
Get out!!
Get out!!
Get out!
Lets.
All right, I know! I know. Yeah, itll be okay.
Oh my God.Whats he gonna do now?
I cant watch!
Oh.
Seriously, how can you watch this?
Arent you scared?
Terrified.
Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!
Umm, listen there's something I think you should know.
Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse?
Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine.
I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around.
Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I
Fine! Maybe I will too!
Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away.
You-you-you-you  threw my sandwich away!
MY SANDWICH?!!!
MY SANDWICH!!!!!!
Whats the matter, Pheebs?
She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me!
What?!
Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly.
Shes avoiding me, she doesnt want to tell me where my Father is.
She knows, and she wont tell me.
Aww Pheebs, that sucks!
Yeah, well, dont Aww Pheebs, that sucks! me yet.
Where ya going?
Well, shes out of town so, theres gotta be something in her house that tells me where my Father is.
Uh, Pheebs, some people call that breaking and entering.
Well, are any of those people here?!
Oh my God, so do I!
I knew it, wow!!
Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?
Ohh, so cute.
Uh-huh, well! But umm, still Im-Im mad at you.
I know. Im mad at me too.
Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? Im kinda hungry.
Hey! Me too!
All right, stop it. Now youre just doing it to freak me out.
Ok, you can do this.
It's just like pulling off a Band-aid.
Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.
Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.
All right. Well, there you go.  Stop it, stop it, stop it.
Oh my God! That guy at the counter is totally checking you out!
Really?  My God, hes really cute.
Go for it.
Phoebe, Im engaged!
Im just saying, get his number just in case.
But no: Chandler is in an accident and cant perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.
Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, Im engaged.
Well you should be embarrassed.
I did, but that was really fun.
Hey.
Chandler. I sensed it was you.
What?!
Unagi. Im always aware.
Okay, are you aware unagi  is an eel?
Whats up?
I cant figure out what to make Monica.
Oh, why dont you make her one of your little jokes.
Im going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?
Yknow what?
Shed-shed love this.
Uh, its an exact replica of Apollo 8.
I made it in the sixth grade.
Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.
Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didnt actually land on the moon.
But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely.
Wait a minute, I cant give this to her.
Why not?
Because it says "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate Monica" on the bottom.
Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!
He might still show up.
Oh, what are you, stupid? Its been three hours.
Is that all?
I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why dont you tell about your lovely wedding?
Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding.
Um, its going to be a small ceremony.
Uh, tiny!
Were not even sure why were having it.
Its actually going to be just family.
Ohwaityou two think of me as family?! Oh, I have to ask you something now and be honest; do you want me to sing
Come here to me. No-no, you come here to me.

Huh.
Well? Aren't you gonna do something?
Uhh.
You'd better do something, or I'm gonna walk out that door right now! Well? Are you gonna?
Nah.

Dont you think I asked him that before he got in?!
Yknow what? Im not talking to you! You go back to sleep!  And you, are you a rapist?!

Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica?
I cant figure this out!
Its so hard!
Should I get her a  Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or aah-ah!
Paper cut!
Now, have you told anyone else?
No, I dont want to tell anybody else because I dont want Monica to find out.
You told me.
Well, its because I trust you, youre one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.
Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadnt been on the toilet.
Me too.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey! So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse?

I wake up this morning, the strippers gone and the ring is gone!
You slept with the stripper?
Of course!!
What difference does that make?!
Well, I'm justif the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!
Joey, do you have a minute?
Dude, what am I gonna
Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out.
Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!
Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place.
Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have
What-what is it, what is it?
Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone.
Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know!
Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!
I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone!
What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?
And you're not supposed to be gossiping!!
I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the phone
I'm not listening to you!
Oh! Yay! Look! Theres a piece that doesnt have floor on it!
Hey, come on now!
All right, what are we havin?
Uhh, I dont believe in these crazy diets yknow, just everything in moderation.
Ill take those to go.  For the kids.
Oh, I know what I wanted to ask you. You were on the show years ago and then they killed you off. What happened there?
It was so stupid, I said some stuff in an interview that I shouldnt have said.
But believe me, thats not gonna happen today.
Understood. So, whatd you say back then?
Well, I said that I
Ha!
So you like the drums!
That's, that's great!
Yknow, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation.

So, yay!
Hey-hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song.  Ready? One, two, three, four...
Tequila!!
That's fun.
Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?
Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.
Im gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
Joey, please dont do that. I think its best that we just forget about it.
Thats easy for you to say, you werent almost just killed.
All right thats it, school is in session!
My God! Is this a gym card?
Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but Ive missed the last 1200 times.
So why dont you quit?
You dont think Ive tried? You think I
Who is Maria?
Oh Maria. You cant say no to her, shes like this lycra spandex covered gymtreat.
You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?
No!
So youre strong enough to face her on your own?
Oh no, youll have to come.
Pheebs, I dont think anyone's mad about that.
Exactly! Because it's in the past!
Anybody gonna eat that?
Pheebs!
Hey!
Listen, you know how uh, when youre wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear?
Yeah!
Well, when Jake did it I saw thathe was wearing womens underwear!
I know. They were mine.
Oh.  No! No wait, thats weird!
No, its not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on.
Thats weird!
Im wearing his briefs right now.
Thatskinda hot.
I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.
Yeah, I wouldnt know about that.
And! Yknow what Jake says? That womens underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.
Yeah well next thing you know, hell be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!
There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! Im thinking even more than you.
Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink lacys.
Im just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in womens underwear!
I dont think you could ever do that.
Hey! I
Okay, whatever.
Lusts of the flesh.
What?
I dont know.  A cowboy theme?
Hey uh, is it okay to come in?
Of course! Oh Joey, this ring Iits beautiful I love it!
Yeah uh look Rach, theres something I gotta tell ya.
Hey!
Hey! Are you ready to try nursing again?
Yeah! Hi Emma. Hey, why do you think she wont take my  breast?
Its all right honey, it takes some babies a while to get it,  but dont worry. Itll happen.
Yowza
Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your  mouth.
Dear Lord.
Im sorry honey, what were you saying?
Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that
Do you think my nipples are  too big for her mouth?
She looks scared.
Doesnt she  look scared?
Yknow, I dont really know her.
Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there.
Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?
Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo.  I added the "a-gogo."
Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.
Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...
No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me.
The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.
Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...
Pathetic mess?
I know, butcome on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable.
I'm thinkin', cha-ching!
Thanks.
Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice.
You're doin' this.
Hi. She said yes.
Yes! Way to go, man!  Still got the egg, huh?
"Happy birthday to you!"
Youre paying for that.
What? No-no its her birthday!
Youve sung Happy Birthday to 20 different women today!
But it really
You are no longer authorized to distribute birthday muffins.
Damnit!
Rach? Hi!
Hi!
Did you tell your sister to ask me out?
Well yeah
Oh wow!
I mean, wow!
I mean, I-I-I think shes cute but I-I would never have thought of going out with her, never!
Really?!
Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured, "Why not?!"
Oh so-so not really never.
I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am.
I mean after all weve been through, I justyknow I wish I had a brother to reciprocate.
Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing.
Oh-ho, and mine!
No-no wait-wait! I cant just let you hang up! Just please talk to me.
WellI only have one thing to do today.  I guess I could push it back.
Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?
Its just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist!
Chandler?
I-Im sorry?
No look, I-Im sure that people know you exist!
Oh yeah?
I work in a cubicle surrounded by people.
Ive been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself and no ones even looked up from their desk.
Hang-hang on.
Hey everybody!
Uh, Im gonna kill myself!
I got nothing.
Apparently, theres like a million guys out there that can play Mac, and theres only this one robot and this one guy who controls it!
I didnt know he could get me fired!
What am I going to do?
Well yknow Joey, youre a pretty charming guy.
Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.
No sweetie, youve got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! Youve got to kiss some serious robot ass!
Thats not a bad idea.
Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow Im not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys.
Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs.
So do you think uh, Joeys more charming than me?
Yeah! Thats why Im sleeping with him on the side.
Yeah, you wish.
"You wish."
Why are you yelling?
Whoa, that
Whoa-whoa, what is it?
Well Its a date.
A date?!
No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you wouldnt schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!
Come on Joey, dont make me feel badly about this.
No, Im gonna!!
Thats right!
Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about goin out with that girl!
Like-like-like I did something terrible to you!
And now Pheebs, youre doing the same thing!
ThatIts not the same thing! This is

Oh yeah, Id love that.

Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!

And I feel like Ive conquered the business world, and I feel like Ive conquered the intellectual world, and now I-I have the most beautiful woman in the world.
Wow.
Theres one thing missing.
Whats that?
Its time for me to conquer the physical world.
Okay.
Monica, I want to become  the Ultimate Fighting Champion.
You wanna what?!
I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion! Its the most intense physical competition in the world, its banned in 49 states!
What are you talking about?
Okay, my trainer, Ho Chi, is teaching me a combination of Gee Koon Doe and Brazilian street fighting, Ive even had my own octagon training ring designed.
And I suppose you used a ring designer for that.
Yeah.
Monica, I want you there in the front row when I win.
I want you close enough to smell the blood.
What do you think?
My parents will be so happy.
Okay to come in?
Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again.
Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?
What?!
Im the ruptured spleen.
Why would you do that?
Because you shouldnt be with him.  You should be with me.
Really?
When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me!
Look, things like last night they dont just happen.
Or at least not to me.
Or with the other two women, in the morning yknow I was just lying there and I couldnt wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always yknow with a friend.
Chandler!
I know you probably dont want to go out with me, yknow because I make too many jokes and Ive never been in a serious relationship and I guess Im not technically a "doctor"
There was just one woman, wasnt there?
No, there were two.
Including me?
Oh yeah.
Hey!
Welcome back!
Hey!  Can we pick up where we left off?
I dont know, Im still pretty tired out from this afternoon.
Why?
Uh, the sex.
What sex?

We didnt have sex.
Well if I didnt have sex with you, I had sex with someone that looked an awful lot like
Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!
Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! No! No! No!
Oh my God Stu! I-I cant believe you did this! Now are you absolutely sure shes a hooker?
Either that or shes just the best, most expensive date I ever had.
Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.
Im your mother.
Ehh?
Oh, and then Monica joked that she wouldnt go out with a guy like Chandler...
Hi there.
...and he couldnt let it go, and... I dont really know what happened with that either.
And then Rosss new girlfriend, Bonnie, shows up and Rachel convinced her to save her head.
And then Ross and Rachel kiss, and now Ross has to choose between Rachel and the bald girl and I dont know what happened there either...
Y'know what, hold on, let me go get Chandler.
Uh Mr. Morse, can I speak to you for a moment?
Well yeah, I lied before.
Oh!
Oh God

Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as Laser Floyd was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes!
Thats when it occurred to me, the key to my success, the munchies. So I ah, started hitting the NYU dorms around midnight.

Bijan for men?  Bijan for men?  Bijan for men?
Hey, Joey. So did you hear about the new guy?
I could have birds.
Okay, Mr. Heckles, we'll try to keep it down.
Thank you. I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.
All right, bye-bye.
Okay, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky.
We'll give you Janice.
I miss Janice though.  "Hello, Chandler Bing."
"Oh, my, god."
"Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it. There, faster!"
Stop with the broom, we're not making noise.
We won. We won!
Mr. Heckles.
How did this happen?
He musta been sweeping. They found a broom in his hand.
That's terrible.
I know. I was sweeping yesterday. It coulda been me.
Sure, you coulda. You never know.
You never know.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Where's Chandler?
Oh, he needed some time to grieve.
I'm free! I'm free!
That oughta do it.
Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning.
Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?
Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale.
I didn't know there were docks.
Hey.
Hey.
Aww, is it broken?
No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks.
Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?
Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.
Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.
What is this? Fruit?
Monica's making jam.
Whoa, jam! I love jam!  Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?
Because the kids need new shoes.
I'm going into business people.
I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard.
I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man.
What's the opposite of man?
Jam.
Oh Joey don't!
It's way to hot.
This will just be my batch.
Why? Do you think hes still mad at us?
Well hes probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.
What? Mine arent tinted.
Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies?
I will have one.
Okay, Im not gonna have one.
No, no, its just my tooth.
All right Ill have one.
So whats a matter, you need a dentist? Ive got a good one.
No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I cant see him.
See that is the problem with invisible dentists.
Why? Why cant you go to him?
Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.
That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienists blouse.
Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!
Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend Albino Bob.
And all these people actually died?
Yes, while I was in the chair!
Thats why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, its not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!
Pheebs, come on, you didnt kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist.
Its, its, its just ah, a coincidence.
Well tell that to them. Oh! You cant, their dead.
Hello?
Ross.
It was dreadful. I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those wonderful things.
No, no, that-that, thats all right. Umm, Im just glad you called.
Ross umm, theres something that Ive got to tell you, theres-theres someone else.
Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?
You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.
Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.
So, let's go.
Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.
Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them  for us to leave now.
You know, the guys are probably having a great time.
Okay, Ive got three of my five.
Three of your five, what?
Celebrities Im allowed to sleep with.
Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought.
Yeah, its hard okay, I only have two spots left.
All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?
Okay, Elizabeth Hurely....
Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.
Susan Sarandon.
Eh, y'know what, shes to political, she probably wouldnt let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first.
And!! Isabella Rosselini.
Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know shes too international, y'know shes never gonna be around.
So?
So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody whos gonna be in the country like all the time.
Yeah, cause thats why you wont get Isabella Rosselini, geography.
Oh thats five Ross. Five women have had five babies! And I have had no babies! Why doesnt she want to come out?
Yknow what I think it is?
I think youve made such a nice home for her over the last nine months that she just doesnt want to leave.
Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God!
Twenty-one hours, youre a hero.
Doctor you gotta do something! I think you gotta give me drugs or you gotta light a fire up in there and just smoke it out.
Actually, I think youre ready to go to the delivery room.
What?
Ten centimeters, youre about to become a mom.
My God. Okay.  Ha-ha-ha beat ya! Sucker!
Are they here yet?
No, honey, they're not, but don't worry, because we are going to find them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok?
Ok.
Hi.
May I see your boarding pass?
Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend.
Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass.
No, I know, but Ihe just went on.
He's right there, he's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just...
No no no! Federal regulations!
OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is
Alright. What's the message?
Uh... I don't know.
Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you.
What?
It's from Rachel. She said that she loved the present, and she will see you when you get back.
: Toby... Oh, for God's sake, I don't know what she's talking about!
There's no Rachel!
Here's the thing, Janice.
You know, I mean, it's like we're different.
I'm like the bing, bing, bing.
You're like the boom, boom, ... boom.
Ow!
Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?
Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back.
I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.
Oh my god.  How many of those have you had?
Oh, I don't know, a million?
Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la.
I'm fine.
All right.
I'm not fine. Here she comes.
Wait here. Breathe.
How do you do that?
It's like a gift.
We should always always break up together.
Oh, I'd like that.
You win.
Well, what did you have?
It doesnt matter because nothing beats a three and a six.
That my friend is D-Cup.
Okay, now much have you won so far?
Uh,  wow, 700.
Not 700 exactly?
Yeah.
Double it!
What?
Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.
Really?
Hey, I didnt make up the rules.
Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card.
Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500.
Dont get to excited because thats not gonna happen unless you getNo way!
Im, Im sorry you didnt get to go to Spacecamp, and Im hoping that maybe somehow, this may make up for it.

If shes no fun, why do you want to date her at all?
Well, I-I want to give her another chance, yknow?
She lives so close.
And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that wasif she was kidding was very funny.
On the other hand, if she wasnt kidding, shes not fun, shes stupid, and kind of a racist.
Hey!
Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?
Damn!

"Well, it's right by my house, all right!"
Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea.
Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey!
Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I justy'knowstop it!

Thats it!
Is that it?
Yes. Yes, he says Im damaged goods.
So, youre like a zillionaire?
And youre our age. Youre our age.

Absolutely!
Now get out of here you!!
Okay, Im running out of places I can touch him!
Look, is there something wrong with me?

I mean, seriously, does it sound like somethings wrong with me?
No.
Okay, Im gonna go get Frank.
So, were walking down the street and I turn to you and I say, Hey, lets go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes, remember?
And then, and then, you turn to me and say, Nah, lets just hang out at your place. Well, that was a nice move dumb ass.

You know what else Im not gonna miss?
"Im Monica.
I wash the toilet 17 times a day.

"Im Monica, I dont get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!"
Hey! I call her!
"Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!"
"Oh my God, I cant find a boyfriend!

Item J437-A, color: winterberry.
Hi umm, listen come here, come in.
Im so-so sorry about yesterday.
I-Im really sorry.
Its just that I
Listen Ross, you dont have to apologize. I understand why you were there.
You do?
Yeah, you still have feelings for me.
And-and to be honest, I-I still have feelings for you.
And I wish that we can work it out Ross, but we cant.
Its too complicated with you and Rachel and the baby, I-I just It just wasnt meant to be.
Oh God youre right.
Ross, wewe have to be strong. Okay, I-Im gonna go.  Can I? To remember you?
No.
Im telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy.
Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I dont want to make it savory.
Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it.
Gimme this.
Hi! Okay, dont be mad at me, but I couldnt resist.
Brides magazines?
Yes, and I know that youd say no if he asked you, but Im sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin.
Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway.  Like for clubbing.
It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes.
I know its a little sudden, and its a little rushed, and its totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesnt mean I cant.
Right?
I mean Im-Im crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.
Oh my God.
I know.  I need more pie.
Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?
You didnt break up with that fireman?
No, that was my way of telling you.
Well, it turns out hes incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints.
He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.
Wow!
Yeah, well hed prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.
So then, are you going to dump Jason?
Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and Okay so Jason is sensitive,  but now sos Vince  Plus, Vince has the body y'know?
So Its really just about the math.
Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41.
Ok, look! Enough is enough!
No, I have just to have two more points to beat him!
Monica, that was also true an
I can't just walk away! I've put in four hours!
You knew this about me when you married me!
You agreed to take me in sickness and in health.
Well, this is my sickness!
Oh yeah-yeah, the lobster.
Yeah, I mean I was up sick all night.
Yeah me too, all night.
Really?! How come we didnt cross paths?
Yeah well thats because uhI stayed in my room. Yeah, you dont want to look in my hamper.
I cant believe there is a naked hooker in there!
Wait! Wait! Maybe shes a hooker
Yeah, okay lets leave these two alone.
No! I do not care what my hormones are doing, I am not going to just do it with some random guy!
Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this!
So.
So.
I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit.
I mean, you know, we've never really talked.
I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?
I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.
Really? Me?
Oh my god, are you kidding?
Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't.
Well, you're not totally paranoid.
Oy.
Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.
Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?
Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.
I'd love it too. Shoot, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you later.
All right, Julie.
Bye.
Bye.  What a manipulative bitch.
Chandler, I found the perfect ring.
Oh, thats uh, thats pretty nice but Im gonna go with the one I picked first.
Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. Its over!
What?
Some guy bought it. Im sorry. I tired to stop it but they  put me in jail!
They put you in jail?
The little jail between the doors!
Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!
I know, Im sorry! But yknow, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.
Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.
Maybe it was the guy.
It was the ring!
No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?
Well, if you want, I'll justI'll just break it off with her.
No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me.
Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.
Thanks, Bernice.  Let's go away this weekend.
Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..
We can, we can go to Aruba!
When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice.
You would've liked it.
I had a bra.

Uh-huh.
Sit down.
Okay.
But your chin here.  Now, you'll feel a small puff of air in each eye.
What?!
A small puff of air, now come on!
Sure, now Im scared.
No, we can go together! Just dont wait too long though, okay? Cause Im outta here sometime before Friday.
Yeah, but I dont wanna die!
No-no, itll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!
Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert.
Oh, hey.
Hi.
Youve have lipstick right here . Thats okay, its mine, we just kissed.
Hey!
Hey!
No. Y'know how were always saying we need a place for the mail.
Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step.
Youre building a post office?
No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. Its a one day job, max.
Okay.  My word! Those are snug.
Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valentes.
Power saw kinda got away from me there.
Hi!
Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!
So just bring it back downstairs, whats the problem?
I cant seem to say goodbye.
Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?
Well Ive forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
It was cheesecake.
It was fine.
It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling  Wow!
My whole mouth just filled with saliva!
Yknow what? Forget it!
Yeah and well drop it off downstairs so that were not tempted.
Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
Mommas Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois.
This ones from me.
Ahh!
It wasnt on your list, but hopefully youll think its really fun.
A scooter!
Stick to the list. Always stick to the list.
No! No-no, I love it. Thank you.
Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!
Okay.
Now that youre a couple, we dont get two presents from you guys?
For my last birthday you gave me a
Okay.
Happy birthday Grandma!
Its better to be over the hill  then buried under it.
All our love Monica and Chandler.
Thats funny, yeah!
No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
No, I know! I get it! Its funny!
No, because youre not a grandmother!
No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I dont have any of those things.
Thats why its so funny.
All you had to do was buy the card!
Hey, Joey. What's going on?

Phoebe, Sandras mad at you too. It-it doesnt bother you?
Oh, thats veryReally very-very okay.

Am I interrupting?
Uh yes! Thank you.
Oh. Oh wait no.
Later.
Oh uh, Im sorry.
No Ross! Ross! Ross! My child has no father!

I already fed her.
I know, thats why I said again!
Alright you guys, we cant turn on each other, Okay?  Thats just what she wants.
Hey.
Phoebe! Rachel! Its Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice!  Oh.
Oh Monica, we are so sorry.
For what?
Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.
And then for forgetting to invite you to it.
You al-you already had it?
Well, we called everyone in your phone book and a bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.
Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you dont have either.
We ruined everything.
Ugh
Well no, wait a minute, thats not true!
No, what did, that was really sweet.
And it kinda works out for the best.
What do you, what do you mean?
Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love!
I mean, I get all those presents  without having to talk to people I dont even like!
Surprise
Surprise
Monica.
I can't believe it's raining again! Oh, it's so unfair!!!
Well, on the bright side, now you won't have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off.
Not you guys.
You got it going on!
So, what are we gonna do today?
They have a game room downstairs! Ping pong and stuff.
Ping pong?  Honey, they have ping pong! Let's play!
I don't think so!
Why not?
Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!
I'm not always that bad!
Oh,
I punched you...?
And...?
... Phoebe...?
... and...?
I clunked your heads together!
Sorry I ah, I scared you in there.
Oh, thats okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower massager.
Yeah.
Hey!
I tried to reach you at work. Theres....been a fire.
What?! Oh my...  Oh my God!! What happened?!
Well, we believe it originated here.  In the Aroma Room.
All right. Did everyone get out okay?
Well, the giraffes okay. And so is the pirate.
Ohh. What is this?
No Phoebe, dont look! You dont want to see whats under there!!
Ohh, the-the Foster puppets!
Hey! How long until Petes fight?
Oh, about five minutes. Right now theyre interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.
Hot dog?
Four, please.  Im really nervous.  Thank you.
So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?
I gotta tell you, I-I wasnt expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasnt expecting to like anyone right now, but shes really terrific.
Ohh, thats too bad!
No, I-Im saying I liked her.
Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea.
Pheebs, I think shes great. Okay? Were going out again.
Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?
Hey! Which ones my turkey burger?
Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.
Hey, the fights starting!
Okay, well be right in.  So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?
Nine times!
Okay, I had to put on lotion!
But, its gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow Im conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.
Fights over!
Okay, okay, here she comes!  How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesnt want to get married?
Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy.  I never noticed that before.
Hi guys!
Hey!
What are you up too?
Oh, just hanging out, talkin about uh, websites.
Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.
Yeah, Big Brother.
Well thats a little crazy. Although I am yknow glad to hear that youre branching out on what you look at on the Internet.
Yeah, well Yknow, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?
Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!
Eh
Okay well thats good to know.
The Mr. Bowmonts here!!!
Oh thats great, my friend Joeys in the movie business.
Yknow who I ran into from school? Howie.
My friends name is Joey.
Apparently Howies editing now.
Yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie.
Can you believe that?!
Yknow I-I-I havent spoken to him in like ten years and he asks me for a favor!
Yeah, Ive always hated that Howie.
No, no "How you doing?" Man, I mean not even a cup of coffee first!
The nerve huh?
Yeah!
Refill?
Hey! How you doing?
Good! Good, long time no see.
Like your sweater.
Oh hey, right back at ya.
Oh, its crazy about Rachel huh?
Yeah. SheWell, shes one crazy lady?
So whose is it?
Umm, I dont some Italian guy. Come on, read your own label. See you later.
Okay.
He is so weird.
You wanna fool around with Joey?
Yeah!
You know, ever since I had that dream about him, and can't    get it out of my head!
And what's the big deal, people do it all the time!
Who? Who do you know that are friends that just fool around?
Ok, off the top of my head... Don and Janet.
Who, who are they?
I know them from work.
Both of them?
No, one of them...
Which one?
I don't know, what were the names I just said?
Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated.
All right, all right, you're right
What the hell are you cooking!
Oh my God! How did you get back here?!
Fire alarm?  Oh! Hi, officerfireman, can-can I help you?
We found your fire alarm in the trash chute.
Thats not mine.
Yes it is.
How do you know?
The next time you want to dump a fire alarm in a trash chute, dont wrap it in a blanket that says, "Property of Phoebe Buffay not Monica."
Okay do youOkay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America!
Please reattach this, its against the law to disconnect them.
Fine!  But please God.. tell me how to stop them from going off!
Theres a reset button under the plastic cover.
Theres a reset button?!
My God!
Why didnt I see that!
Reset button, reset button, where is there a reset button?
Oh here it is!
Oh!
Ohh, God!
Four letters: "Circle or hoop".
Ring dammit, ring!
Thanks.
Hey, you know our phone's not working?
What?!
I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.
I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!
Just like you told her you did!  ... Just pointing out the irony.
Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?
Nngghhh!!!!!!!
Can I use your phone?  Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please.
"Heating device."
Radiator.
Five letters.
Rdtor.
Yeah, is Sidney there?  Oh, this is?  Sidney's a woman.
Well, you'll have to wait your turn.
Well, how long do you think it'll be?
Any minute now.
Hey, this-  Heyy...
Hey.
Hey! Any good mail?
Yes, you got something from the Screen Actors Guild.
Ooh, its probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, Im kinda.
"Benefits lapsed."
Hmm thats weird. I dont remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.
Okay, its not a check. Theyre saying your health insurance expired because, you didnt work enough last year.
Let me see that!
All right.
Oh, I cant believe this!
This sucks!
When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, yknow?
And it wouldnt matter.
Now I gotta be careful?
Im sorry man, theres never a good time to  stop catching on fire.
All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. Im gonna go see my agent.
Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.
look both ways before you cross the street.
I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!
I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.
I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.
Do you know anything about women?
No.
That's all right.
Okay.
Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.
Yeah. He could row like a viking.
Hi.
Mmm.
So how'd it go?
Oh, y'know..
Did he mention us?
He said he's really gonna miss you guys.
You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere.
...love you.
Are you're hands still wet?
Uh, moist, yeah.
Let's dry 'em again.
Oh my God! Oh my God!!
Still crying?
Like a
Yknow, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex.
Whats the other one?
I dont know, Ive never had to use the other one.
Im just saying yknow, if were having sex, hes not gonna be talking.
Oh thats right.
Youre the talker.
Anyway uh, great idea!
Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy him some more tissues.
Oh, we have some
No you dont!
Okay, yeah.  Triple A can pick us up.
Yeah, what town are we near?
Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?
Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route were on?
Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27.
Okay.  We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay.  There is no Route 27.   Okay, either 93 or 76?
I dont know, Im sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here.
Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93?
Okay!
Yeah, no they dont do that.
Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.
Who?
I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half?
I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.
No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!
But if...
No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, youll have to think of something else.
Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back.
So the going for help went well?
Im telling you man, I saw it.
Yeah, well, youre wrong! Okay, youre wrong.
Im not wrong! I wish I was. Im sorry. Bet that barium enema doesnt sound so bad now, huh?
I know.
Lets try a lookof far offwonderment.
Okay, well-well gaze into our future and well think about our marriage and the days to come.
Chandler!
What is the matter with your face?!
I mean this picture is supposed to say "Geller and Bing to be married," not "Local woman saves drowning moron!"
Hey!
Dont laugh at him!
Hes
Were gonna find love!
Definitely!
Yeah, Im pretty confident about that.
Thats what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler!
It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.
What do you mean?
Well yknow, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time theyre 40, they marry each other.
You mean a backup?
Exactly!
Yeah, yeah I got that.
You do?
Hm-mmm
Who?
Yeah!
Are you serious?!
Yeah, I locked him years ago!
Wh So If neither of you are married by the time youre 40, youre gonna marry Joey.
Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.
Oh, seriously?
Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?
Yeah, Im sorry man.  You wanna go watch?
Yeah!
Good morning.
Hi Tag! Hey, so did you have fun with uh, with Joey last night?
Oh yeah! We went to the Knicks game.
Ohh thats nice.
Then we went to this bar and he hooked us up with all these women!
Wo-women? You mean like old women?
Well kinda old, like 30.
Oh.
And I never used to be able to just talk to girls in bars, but I got like 20 phone numbers last night.
Thats great! Wow man, so Joey mustve really taught you some stuff huh?
A little.
Yeah?
How you doin?
Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing!
I know.
So does it really hurt as bad as they say?
What did you just say?
You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.
Are you serious?!
Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it!
What do you say?
Okay!
Okay! Come on! Let's go! All right!
Okay! That's a four! And where-where's the other one?
It went under the table.
Nobody move!  Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way!
Here it is! Here it is!
That could be a four or a five. It's your call.
It's a four.
I think so too.
Well thats it. Im done. Whew!  There come the meat sweats.
Well Joey, were allwere all very proud of you.
Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now.
Is there anything we can do for you?
No just, nobody press on my stomach.
You can keep those pants by the way.
Whoaheywh-wh-what do you got there? What is that? Pie?
Yeah, you want some?
Ah, just cut me a little sliver.
A little bigger.
Little bigger.

Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
I need to talk to you, its pretty urgent. Its about Monica and Chandler.
Oh my God!
Of course, of course.
Umm, would you please excuse me for a moment?
Umm, do you know each others hometowns?
Why dont you   Wh-whats going on?
Well, umm, not much.
But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, yknow?
So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?
Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-whats wrong with Monica and Chandler?
Nothing..Why?
Phoebe, you said it was urgent!
Oh yeah it is! Im going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.
Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?
Oh, Im sorry. Im so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?
Look, look, theres got to be a way we can work past this.
Okay,  I cant imagine, I cant imagine my life without you.
Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart.
Your good heart Rach,  and, and....
No.
I cant, youre a totally different person to me now.
I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever.
God, and now I just cant stop picturing with her, I cant,  it doesnt matter what you say, or what you do, Ross.
Its just changed, everything.
Forever.
Yeah, but this cant be it, I mean.
Then how come it is?
Windows are clean, candels are lit.
Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt.
Did I turn the fish?
No, cause I made lasagne.
Am I out of control?
Just a touch.
Mon, I don't understand.
I mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms?
I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh.
What?
Could tonight be the Night?
I don't know.
Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know.
Things happen, and they happen.
You don't plan these things.
So, did you shave your legs?
Yeah.
Ross!
Okay, Raymond, Joey you're up.
Hi!
Okay, uh well, let's try one. Whenever you guys are ready.
Uh-oh.
Is there a problem?
Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato.
But that's okay, no problem.
No problem.
Hmm, noodle soup.
Y'know, that's-that's fine, but the line is, "Hmm, soup."
Oh, what did I say?
Hmm, noodle soup.
How's that different?  Oh! Yeah!
All right, let's try one.
Hmm, noodle soup.
Okay. Let's do it again.
Okay.
Hmm, soup.  I mean, noodle soup. I mean soup!

Y'know what? We need to move on.
No! No! I-I can do it one more time! See? Look!  Hmm, noodle soup. Damnit!
Okay. Just give us a second. Ross!
Yeah?
Give her some money.
I really think theyre out of rooms.
Theyre not!! Ross, theyre just saving them for the important people!! Okay?! What-what if I was the president?!
Well then wed be in a lot of trouble, you dont know where any countries are.
Okay.
Uh, say would you umm Would you mind checking again to see if any umm, private rooms may have  opened up?
This is a hospital.
Yknow what?
Id have to say I really dont care for your tone.
And this is not the only hospital in this city and we have no problem toWhoa!
Oh gosh!
What-what?
Ow! Ow! Contraction.  Ow-ow! Ow-ow!
Would you like to see a semi-private room?
Yeah, it couldnt hurt to look.
I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.
That's funny. Who are they?
The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend.
You mean they're lovers.
If you wanna put a label on it.
Wow, uh, anything else I should know?
Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this.
Okay, quick and painful.
Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me.
Oh, what? What-what?
Y'know Marcel?
...Yeah?
Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him.

Yeah!
And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!
Ooh, now you lost me.
You stole the phone!
No I didnt!
No? So youre saying that if I called it, it wouldnt ring?
No. Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag.  Oh, it does work!

Fine.

Well, here's your phone doctor.
Hey guys.
Hey Gunther. Hi.  I mean youre going out on a date with the noisy guy upstairs?

Oh, it's not!
Seriously, it's moving!
What the hell is in there?
It's just my knitting that's all!  Yes! I knit this. I'm very good.
There will come a time in each of your careers when youll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor.
I had such an opportunity in the recent, present.
And Im ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually.
Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him.
And now, hes got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me Im stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV.

Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts.
Oh, right, that's me!
Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.
Fine.
Phoebe, what is it?
All right, you know Paolo?
I'm familiar with his work, yes...
Well, he made a move on me.
Whoa, store will be open tomorrow!

Yeah,  oh, but oh...
Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas....
Destiny.
Sure.
Yes.
All right.
Okay.  Yikes! That one doesnt look very fulfilled.
Oh, thats, thats ah, one of the old ones, hes just taking it to the back.
You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist.
Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.
So, what happens to the old guys?
Well, they go into the chipper.
Why, do I have a feeling thats not as happy as it sounds?  No! Nooooo!!!
Hey! Hey!!
Light still out?
Yeah.
Oh. Maybe they're- napping.
Oh please, they're having sex.
Shut up!
So, whaddya think George is like?
I think he's shy.
Yeah?
Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.
Hi! Hi, Im Ross, you dont know me, but Im a big, big fan of yours. I mean,
Arent you with that girl over there?
Well, yeah, kinda.
Um, but thats okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people,  so Im allowed to sleep with you.
No, no, no, its flattery.
Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella.
Dont, dont just dismiss this so fast.
I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...
Yeah, for you. Is that the list?
Um, yeah.
May I see it?
Um, no.
Come on!
But, okay.
Im not on the list!
Um, see, but thats not the final draft.
Its laminated!
Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler  brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped you for Wynona Rider, local.
Y'know its ironic...
...because I have a list of five goofy coffee house guys and yesterday I bumped you for that guy over there.
Were just gonna be friends.
Get out of here you lurker!  Go on! Get!
Hey Pheebs!
Ohh! You made up!
Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long.
Yeah, she couldn't live without the Chan Love.
Ohh, get a room.
We have one.
I know. Use it.
Oh Mon, listen I have to ask!
Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment, now does he do this with a lot of girls?
Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot!
Ohh! And Im one of them!! Wow! Oh, I just cannot believe this! I mean, Joey Tribbiani!
Well, yknow its none of my business, but arent you married?
Yeah. Oh I just wish we could not be married for a little bit! Yknow I just wish we could be like on a break!
Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!
So thats the only reason she could be here huh?
It couldnt have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe Im a good listener and I uh I put on a
Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!
I think I can take care of myself, Ill talk to you later.
Good-bye.
Whoa!
Uh, that was your sister actually.
She-she thinks that youre just using me.
So?
Im sorry.
What are you doing here?!
I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays.
What?!
Umm, okay, okay, look.
I took this picture from your fridge.
Okay, because I know that this is my Father.
Yeah, this is Frank Buffay and you are standing right there next to him.
Now, look I deserve to know where I came from.
All right?
So if you can help me find my Father then you should!
Otherwise, youre just mean!
So, just tell me the truth!
All right, the man in the picture is Chuck Magioni.
My Father is Chuck Magioni?
No, no, thats just Chuck Magioni, I-I sold him a house last year!
And Im very sorry, but I dont know where your Father is, and thats the truth.
Oh.
But umm, youre right.
I think that a person should know where they come from.
Wh-which is why I ah,  ahh,  okay.
Im your mother.
Heh?
Y'know I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I just, I kinda felt all floopy, and...
Whats happening to your accent?
Come again?
Whats-whats this nonsense?
All right, Im-Im not English.
Im from Long Island.
I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out.
Im sorry.
So, if we could just get back to the lecture.
Umm, were there any questions?
About paleontology.
All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression.
Obviously, I screwed up.
But what you guys think of me is really important because Im-Im hoping to get a permanent job here.
So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression
Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am
Well, hello Rachel!
Where you going, Joe?
For a walk.
Oh. You mind if I join you?
Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize    my thoughts.
Your thoughts? Plural?
Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny,    I gotta see her!
I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.
Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her??
You guys are killing me!
She's forbidden fruit!
It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable    boy ... Why are you doing this, huh?
Did Ross tell you not to let me go over    there?
Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.
Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against    the world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.
Great novels?
Fine ... mediocre porn
Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but were gonna have to get into Mr. Zelners office.
Now, he doesnt get in until 10, so hes no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.
Thats kinda sad.
Yeah, well Betty is kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates.  Now, while I distract her,
Got it!
Lets roll!
Hello Rachel, you uh, got a minute?
Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you anythingminute. Okay. Fine.  Abort the plan, abort the plan.
Uh actually, Id like to speak with both of you.

Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?
Yeah! Thank you so much for letting me stay here.
Oh! No problem! I
What?
You are iron.
You are steel!
Let me ask you something, how come when I call your computer support line, I have to wait an hour and a half?
I told you, were adding new operators all the time. Could we concentrate on my training?
I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!
Look, you and I went to different high schools...
Okay, that doesnt help me, because we went to the same high school.
You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chips motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket.
I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.
They had to have that specially made?!
It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.
Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!
Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now hes-hes called me up and asked me out.
And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go.
I-I owe her this.
I never let her eat.
Oh, you go out with him.
Oh, really?!
Yeah. Just, if its possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?
Ill try.
Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that youre dancing with.
Yeah, yeah, okay.
Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown  Im trying to win her over, so I was wondering if..

Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.
Why would we do that?
Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.
Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.
Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything.  Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!

Me too, we should get goin'.

Why do they keep doing that?
If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms.
Theyve been taping those people up there all day.
Right.
Hey, whatd you guys do to get up on there?
Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?

Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.
Really?! I-I thought you werent looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
Well, y'know, possibly.  You didnt tell him that, though? Right?
Ummmmmmmm, no.
You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You dont tell the guy that!
Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first dateoh, hes so gonna get the wrong idea.
Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.
Oh, yeah. Had that dream.
Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.

Thanks sweetheart. Give me a little sugar here.  Okay.
Okay, in we go.

Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate.
So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is.
Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?
Oh my god.
What?
Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.
Come on, they're close.
Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.
Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.
Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it'snot really true, is it?
Well, who's to say what's true? I mean...
Oh my god, what were you thinking?
All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.
Oh!
Ow!
I'm outta here.
Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.
Really?
Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.

Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
Huh. That's nice.

No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.
Really?
You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?
No, no, they will. I just... uh...
Can't wait.
Do I know you?
Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been?
Good, good, I'm a lawyer now.
You can't be a lawyer. You're eight.
Listen, it was nice to see you. I gotta run backstage.
Uh, wait, backstage?
Oh, yeah, my firm represents the band.
Ross.
Chandler.
Look, you guys wanna meet the group?
Come on.
So, are you one of the ones who fooled around with my dad?
Do you have any respect for your body?
Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?
Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease.
The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.
Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you.
Really?
He does?
Hey, buddy, what's up!
Oh, she told you about that, huh.
Well, yeah, I have one now and then.
Well, yeah, now.
Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before.
Well, okay, thanks!
God, he's good.
If only he were a woman.
Yeah.
Oh, look look look.
The last candle's about to burn out.
10, 9, 8, 7... ... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48....
Thank you.
Thanks.
Kinda... spooky without any lights.
Bwah-hah-hah!
OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah...
Oh.. oh... oh.
Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.
All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are you about keeping Ben in your life?
You blew them away!
Oh, I can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face!
I mean... uh, did you know you were  mouthing the words along with me?
I was
No, it's ok! Made me feel like a rock star!
Oh my God!  I'm your
I'd better not found you naked in my hotel room!
Look, I took it too far!
Okay, Monica: Right foot red.
Could've played
Thanks.
Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. Good.
Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the
Oh, okay. Will you take my place?
Alright.  Yes, this is Rachel.
Nooo!
Hello?
Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much.
Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really.
Green. To the green.
I've got magic beans.  Never-never mind.
To the left, to the left- aww!
Ohhh... I'm fine.
Hey!
Please tell me you got the message!
What message?
The actor playing Mac couldnt do it, they needed to see you at 2 oclock.
What?! Its 6 oclock!
Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board!
I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya!
I went to Rosss!
I went to the coffeehouse!
I went to any place that they made sandwiches!
Thats the day youre gonna die? Seedarnit, Ive got shuffleboard that day.
Thats what you think.
Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmothers? Wouldnt they have the recipe?
Well, yknow I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse.
What was her name?
Nestley Toulouse.
Nestl Toll House?
Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.
Yes!!  Oh.
I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!
I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why  youre burning in hell!!
So, we're decided, no on plaid, yes on pink?
Absolutely!
I am so on board!
Rachel didn't you just light that?
Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back, y'know?  Good luck, Rach.
I've actually been thinking about quitting lately.
Oh sure, every Sunday night I'm telling myself I'm quitting but every Monday morning it's like
Tell me about it!
Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!
It does sound appealing.
Oh, I never could do it.
Oh but you could.
You can.
Absolutely!
We can help each other out!
We can get--what are those--those patches!
We could be like the Patch Sisters!
Oh y'know, we really should quit. Okay, let's quit!
Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it!
My late husband gave me that lighter.  I'm not kidding.
Okay then!
Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?
Does, um, anyone wanna see?
Nooo..
Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!
It's worse than the thumb!
Hey, this is so unfair!
Oh, why is it unfair?
So I have a flaw!
Big deal!
Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying?
And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word?
And Monica, with that snort when she laughs?
I mean, what the hell is that thing?
...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?
...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
Well, I-I could live without it.
Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?
Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.
Oh,  "you do, do you"?
You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.
"Indeed there isn't"... I should really get back to work.
Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.
Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.
Awww! Mel Torme died.
Joey, that papers like a year old!
Aw! Does that mean the
Hey.
Hey.
You're sure? You're absolutely sure?
Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does.
Probably?
Yeah, I don't like that word.
Kind of what probably really means.
Yeah, uh-huh.
Yeah, oh, "Your mom probably won't kill herself," yknow?
I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on "Probably!"
You gotta take care of yourselves!
In
Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?
Yoo-hoo! Aaron Litman-Neurolic would like to say hello to his future bride.
Ohhh!  Wow! He kinda takes your breath away doesnt he?
Hes a keeper. How are you feeling?
Oh, Im fine.
Can I just say, I really admire what youre doing. Just raising her all alone.
Oh, Im not doing it alone. I have Ross.
Oh, sure. Now. But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married?
Well then he gets a divorce, its Ross!
Im telling you Rachel, listen to Janice. They all say theyre gonna be there until they start their real family.
Well IThats never gonna happen with Ross.
Oh well thats what I thought about my first husband, now Im lucky if my kid gets to spend the weekend with her father and the twins and little Ms. New Boobs.
And Tim I just wanna say, good luck here.
Hey. Whos that?
New people.
What happened to the Disgustingtons?
Theyre having their baby!
Its not fair Ross we got here first!
Right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery.
Oh but not before she gave me a juicy shot of little Jamie just crowning away.
Wow! Sorry. So uh, how are the new people?
Phoebe?
Yeah?
Look at that guy by the window, wow!
Hes awfully short and I think hes talking to himself. And to be completely honest, hes not that good in bed.
Oh, what is wrong with me lately?
I mean its like every guy I seeI mean look here.
Look at that guy for example, I mean normally thats not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way Im feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.
Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?
Yeah.
This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy.
Really?! So this has happened to you?
Oh absolutely yeah!
Oh and keep in mind, now, I was carrying triplets so in, yknow, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy.
Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store sitting on Santas lap.
Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield from a
Ugh!
I dont know what Im going to do!
I called the company that sent and th-they dont care!
Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isnt an emergency, then what is?
Hey guys!
Hey!
Hey
I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party!
And the guys from work had a blast.
Yknow, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before.
Yeah!
And-and another one had never been to a party before, so
So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, thats nice!
Yeah, right!
I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those
That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?
Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.
So you might say, its a magic ring.
OH MY GOD!! I didnt really believe it until you just said it!!
Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.
Obviously! So, how do we decide?
Well now lets-lets look at this objectively, I think I should date her
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
Thats interesting, but check this out. I date her
Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction
Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.
Yeah well we should order some food then.
No Joey! Look why dont, why dont we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, well
That sounds fair.
Maybe Ill take her to that new French restaurant down the street
Ah yeahwait a second now!
Look were gonna have to set a spending limit on the date.
I dont have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.
Well sorry, thats what I do on dates.
All right, well I guess Ill just have to do what I do on dates.
So lets decide on the spending limit
Yeah. Uh, a slicesix dollars?
I was thinking more like a hundred.
Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?
Hi, again.
Hey!
Hey!
Thank you soo, much.
Oh, dont thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work.
You want some help with that?
Oh, no thanks, I got it.  No I dont!
Whoa! Are you okay?
Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.
Its the heat.  And-and the humidity.
Thats a uh, thats a tough combination.
Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?
Like you wouldnt believe.  Wow! This is a great place.
What do you mean?
Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh.
Oh!
Hey, somebody left their keys.
Ooohh, to a Porsche!
Hey Gunther, these yours?
Yeah, thats what I drive. I make four bucks an hour, I saved up for 350 years!
Na-uh!  Hey did anybody lose their keys?
Joey, why dont you put them in the lost and found?
Theres a lost and found?  My shoe!
You left a shoe here?!
Well, I didnt realize until I got home.
I wasnt gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe!
Im gonna go find that guys car and leave a note on the windshield.
Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, Ill be sure to give him your shoe.
Great! Thanks.
Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.
Carol, we've been through this before, ok?
We have a good time.
We laugh, we play.
It's like we're father and son.
Honey, relax. Ross is great with him.  Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person.
Oh, this is so cute.
Oh, I got that for him.
My mommies love me. That's clever.
Hello?
Oh, Hi, JuHi, Jew!
Uh huh?
Uh huh?
Ok.  Um, sure, that'd be great.
See ya then.
Bye.
Did you just say Hi, Jew?
Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.
Now there you go! I wouldnt want my best guest to strain her eyes!
Thanks Monica!
Does that smell bother you?
What the smell from Joeys? No, I can hardly smell it over here.
Well you let me know if you can, because yknow I can bake a pie to cover it.
I can smell it a little, bake the pie.
Okay!
Okay.
Hello?  Oh yes, one minute please.  Its for you. Its the fire inspector.
Oh!  Hello?  Yeah this is Phoebe.  Really?!
Yeah, so it turns out that it wasnt the hair straightener that started the fire.
No-no, it was the candles.
Its very not good leaving candles unattended.
In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is  Uhh Uhh Okay.
Well, I have to go now.
Joey proposed to me.
Is he crazy?! You just had Rosss baby!
Well, I-I said yes.
What?!
Are you crazy?
You just had Rosss baby!
Its-its so  inappropriate.
No, its worse than that.
Its wrong.
Its It is bigger than  mine!
I know.
You cant marry him!
Why not? I dont want to do this alone! And hes such a sweet  guy and he loves me so much.
Well do you love him?
Sure.
Sure?
Yeah, I mean whatever.
Honey, the question isdo you really want to marry Joey?
No. No, I dont. Could you be a dear and go tell him?
So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart?
Here comes the bride.
Oh my God Monica!
I wanna wear this everyday.
You look so beautiful.
Im so happy for me.
Hello?
Hey! Did Chandler show up yet?
Yeah, we got him back. Everythings fine.
Damnit!
I will be! Listen, I dont want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?
Fine.
Fine, but Ill have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel.
And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but Ill go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if thats what you want!
No thats not what I want. Uh, Im glad you guys were bonding but I
Look he doesnt have any brothers or sisters, somebodys gonna have to teach him this stuff!
And I havent taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesnt know anyway!
Crap!!
I gotta go!
Look at that! Look at that! Theyre going into the first class lounge! Do you know what they have in there?
No.
Me neither! We have to get in!
Just act like you belong.
Oh my God! Oranges!
Shh!  Nice to see you again.
Uh sir, may I see your tickets please?
Yes, of course.
Im sorry, would you move your thumb? I cant see the seat number.
Oh thats all right, I have it memorized. Its 1A.
Okay!
Yknow what?
I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids.
All I really needed was a plan.
See I wanna have three kids
Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.
As I was saying I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time Im 35 which gives me five years.
You spent a hundred dollars. Thats the limit. Youre screwed!
Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So technically,
Oh-oh! So thats the way its gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too yknow!
Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?
I dont know.
Why am I not surprised?
Yknow what Ross? Im not gonna let you get away with this!
I dont think you have much choice.
Well well see!
Bye-bye!
Yeah bye-bye!  Hey! So just a light layer?
Yes. Yes. Just here  and there .
Dad?
Im here!
Hey!
Hi. God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work.
Dad, we-we cant believe youre selling the house.
Well, its time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling.
Lets grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.
Im sorry we cant store your childhood things anymore.
Oh, thats okay, I cant wait to see everything again! All of the memories
Well, I dont know whats in the boxes down here, but I do know there are six or seven
I used to
Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.
Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a
Ok, got the vent open.
Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!
Ben, you ready?
All right, gimme your foot.
Ok, on three, Ben.
One, two, three.
Ok, That's it, Ben.
What do you see?
Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent.
Phoebs, It's open! It's open!
Wait! You forgot your legs!
You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system.
Thank you.
Filing system?
Oh-oh!
You mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders?
It certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets.
Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.
I notice that youve been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities.
Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.
Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me. Its amazing how she gets it right almost
I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.
Oh yes, well theres the coffee too.  Rachel can carry two things at once!
Yes, thats very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.
Yes, I realize that
And Rachel shouldnt have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.
I love working with designers!
With them, under them, whats the difference? Eh, Rach?
Chandler, you have an assistant right?
Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!
Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.
I do?
Yeah!  All right, maybe you dont have to smile. Lets try something else. Lets try umm, try looking sexy.
Okay.
Or not.
Where's Chandler?
Here I am.
Wash your hands!!!
How did youknow?
Hey! What's she doing back here?
Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!
Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically...
What happened in Atlantic City?!
Well, Chandler and I are in a bar
Did you not hear me say, "Du-ude?!"
And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay?
So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing.
Now, I know what youre thinking, Chandlers not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and youre right, Chandlers not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out withgirls.
You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.
In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
Oh Mon, I laughed so hard
Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?
Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
So umm, youre gonna stay with me as long as I need you?
Of course I am!
Oh mom, I swear Im not an idiot.
Ive read all kinds of books on pregnancy and giving birth, but I-I just didnt think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes.
And-and then guess what?
The babys coming and I dont know what to do.
Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie?
No. Sweetie, youre gonna be fine.
Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?
Im going to the bathroom.
Okay.
Now dont worry! Everythings gonna be okay.
It
Hey!
Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?
I just Bamboozled Chandler!  Which is not uh sexual thing. That was a quick shower.
Not if you were here.
Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.
Oh my God! This is it!   I really hope its you!
I hope its you.
Me too!
First of all um, I love you both so much and youre both so important to me
Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!
Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade off being maid of honor for each other.
Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine
Yes!!! Oh!!
Hypothetically!
Still.
If Phoebe were my maid of honor
Rachel would be Phoebes, I would be Rachels, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.
Yeah thats actually a pretty good idea.
Yeah, Ill do that. So who gets to be yours?
Well thats the best part. Umm,
Wh-why is that the best part?
Because then I dont have to!
Well of
Im really not deciding!
Fine!
Aww, and good luck to you too!  What a nice lady!
If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a phial of small pox to release in the hallway?
It's not just the drum noise.
Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, "Oh my eye!
Oh god, my eye!"
I mean, it is so annoying.
Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.
Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?
Maybe on some level.
Joey? Could you get that?  What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?
No, Im picking you up for our date. These are for you.
Ohh, Lilies. Joey, theyre my favorite. Thank you.
And, a brownie!
Well, half a brownie.
Actually, its just bag.
Its been a long walk from the flower shop and I was startin to feel faint so
Oh man!
This is so great!
I actually feel like Im going on a real date!
Although, I have a hint of morning sickness, and Im wearing underwear that goes up to aboutthere.
Hey come on now, this is a real date.
Uh, sonice place you got here.
Foosball, huh?
Pizza box.
Oh, a subscription to
Yeah, actually thats my roommates.
I would like to meet him. He sounds like a stand up guy.
Ah yes, but hes very protective of me so youd better watch yourself.
Ah Hey, so this roommate of yoursis he good looking?
Hm-mmm
Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?
Yeah, but Im pretty sure hes gay.
No-no-no-no, hes not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come on!
Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?
Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive.
Ha. Ha, ha.
What?
Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black.
Please! I am not as bad as Ross.
Oh, I beg to differ. The
That was
Oooooh.  : Oh! I got an interview! I got an interview!
Well, not playing raquetball!
He forgot to leave his grip size!
He didn't get the goggles!
Well,sounds like you two have issues.
Goodbye, baby.
Ciao, bela.
Do they wait for me to do this?
So are you gonna tell him?
Why would I tell him?
How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might.
What are you guys doing here?
Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!
...What did I ask?
God. I feel violated.
Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?
Ross, ten o'clock.
Is it? Feels like two.
No,
There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!
Oh. Hel-lo!
She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!
Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.
Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'
Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!
Oh please, could she
He could never get a woman like that in a million years.
Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.
You could do that!
You think?
OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down.
OK.
This is great!  Helen, could you come in here for a moment?
Thank you Helen, that'll be all.
Last time I do that, I promise.
I am so, so, so, so sorry!
Uh-huh.
And I will cook anything you want in here , and do anything in there!
Yeah you will!  And, are you kiddin me?!
Come on Monica, its our Valentines Day. Please? Please-please, please?
Okay.
Okay.
So, are we going in there?
I am!!
Wow!
It actually is in the handbook.
I cant date you or have a hot plate in my office.
I cant believe we have to stop seeing each other.
For what its worth I did appreciate you standing up for me. It felt really nice. It kinda made me like you even more.
I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we cant date. Its against the rules. Its forbidden.
Wow!
What?
Just hearing you describe it as forbidden, its really hot.
Really?
Yeah.
Well I-I-I dont care how hot it is its-its uh, its wrong.
Stop it!
No! No! Its wrong! Its-its-its naughty. Its taboo.
Shut the book!
Lets also get a hot plate!
Rach, youre in a great place in your life. Come on, youve got a great job! Good friends
Yeah! So-so when are you getting married?
Oh Im not, I just like to try these on.
I do the same thing.
Im just kidding. Im getting married July 25
Im just kidding too.  Im getting married in December.
So when are you getting married?
Oh May 15
Oooh its getting close!
So uh, whos your photographer?
Jeffrey
We met with him. Did he show you the photos of the nude wedding he did?
The best man? Wow!
I know! I almost called off my wedding. Oh, whos your band?!
Oh, my fiancee wants the Swing Kings.
Oh, youre so lucky. My fiancee wants the heavy metal band Carcass.
Ooh, is that spelled with a C or a K? Oh my God! It doesnt matter; theyre both great!
Oh yknow what?
Now that you know what you want you should go to Kleinmans and get it half off.
This place is so overpriced.
So, does this  come in another color or
I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time.
It was unbelievable!
We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...
So have you called her yet?
Let her know I like her?
What are you, insane?
It's the next day!
How needy do I want to seem?
I'm right, right?
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.
I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.
Oh, God, just do it!  Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!
Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat.  I got her machine.
Her answer machine?
No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.
So, uh, why didn't you say anything?
Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."
Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!
Okay, okay, what's going on?
Okay, they're just talking...
Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?
So, um, what do you do for a living?
Well, um, for the past few years I've been working.....which is funny because, that wasn't even my major.
Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you.
I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry.
Now that is funny.
Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us?
Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.
I guess.
Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?
Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine.
Come on.
These people'll scooch down.
You guys'll scooch, won't you?
Let's try scooching!
Come on.
Come on.
Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick.
Carol, Kristin.
Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade.
And, Kristin, Kristin......does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major!
Okay.
When I was six years old.
Hm-mm
I wanted a big wheel.
And instead my parents got me this little plastic chicken that you hop around on.
It was embarrassing, kids made fun of me.
That was a pretty tough year.
Thats-thats great!
See?
I already feel like I know you a little better!
Thank you.
Okay, come on.
Now we can go eat.
Lets go.
It was horrible. They called me chicken boy.
Oh!
Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one?
That's patio furniture!
So what, like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside again?" Of course!
What about the birds?
I don't know, birds just don't say, "Hello, sit here, eat something."
You pick one.
All right, how about the ladybugs?
Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!
Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!
Not like that, I won't!  Kip would have liked the birds!
Bijan for men?
Bijan for men?
Bijan for...   Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.

Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.
Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, dont I have to wait a while?
Hey, this isnt like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!
Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.
Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.
Why? What happened to him?
Nothing, hes just really believes in that.
It looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.
Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.
Well, okay, so whats nowgo get, go get the eggs, put em in there.
Okay, itll take just a little while to prepare the embryos.
Embryossss? As in, "More than one?"
Um-hmm, five actually.
Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?
We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach.
Thats it! 25 percent? That means thats its like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!
Hey, yknow I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you stuff like 200 of them in there?
Sweety, now, shes a woman, not a gumball machine.
Okay, well yknow what, dont worry you guys, cause Im-Im gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.
Well, you see, the-the thing is, we-we only got, we kinda have one shot to make it right.

So, umm, were kinda using all the money we have to do it just this one time.

Hey!
Hey!
You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed!
Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down!
Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?!
I don't know, clean places?
Mm, yum!
It's Danny.
Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.
We'll be right there!  Can't you just say it starts later?
What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?!
The fake kind!
Hey, hi, I need a ladle. You got a ladle?
We have a ladle.
Thanks, see you at the party.
Okay, great!
Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, "See you ladle."
You're so efficient. I love you!
Let's go!
No-no-no! We need something old!
Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve.
That'll work!
I don't think so.
Okay, now we just need something borrowed!

That's stealing!
No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.

Nope. Going to the
Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!
No, it is me!
Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in!
Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that.
I'm- I'm Monana!
Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people.
Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.
What?
They've arrested Monica.
Note the painterly lines    and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors    as his elusive subject was light itself.
Now, do you have any idea what you just said?
No, no, my mouth    says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!
Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt    M-O-N-A-Y.
I just...
I wrote that out phonetically for you.
Phonetically?
Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time    for this.
Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, I'm really impressed that    you were able to memorize all this so quickly!
Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on "Days"    I had to say "Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy".
Wow. What does
No idea!
But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I    guess it means "you're gonna get eaten by a bear".
Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?
Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish    of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! .
Nah ah! Nah ah!  No no no! No ad-libbing    and dude, you can't
Come on! you...
No!
Oh.  Oh-oh.
Hey!  What happened to you? Why didnt you come up?
Done!
You just finished?
Well, I wanted to be thorough.
I mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us!
And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!
So umm, does it?
Im sorry.
Does it?
Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole Does it? part just another glance.
What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice!
Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesnt, and if you have to even
No, Rach, no. I dont, I dont, I dont
Are you sure?
Oh, sure! Im sure.
You got married again.
Yes.
So thats your second marriage in two years.
Yes, second in two years. Third overall.
Ross, I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had I so much business from one client.
Why dont you tell me what happened.
Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk
Im sorry, is this the same Rachel whos name you said at the altar in the second marriage?
Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do

There are a couple of forms to fill out.
Easy.
And well need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh, sound mind.
No problem.
And well need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.
Ooh!
Theres no way to do this without her?
Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.
So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones.
But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game.
Alright, here's my $7.50.  But I think you should know that this money is cursed.
What?
Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.
That's alright, I'll take it.
Bad things happen to me anyway.
This way I can break 'em up with a movie.
Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...
You wanna do it right now?
Great!
Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andie McDowell's the girl from

Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That
You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.

And, oh, um, my friend Larry, he wants me to take a picture of a hooker.
You know, we dont really take advantage of living in the city.
Okay, Chandler!
Okay.
And your horoscope says, "On the fifth a special someone is going to give you a gift."
Oh, well thank you in advance.

Hey guys!

I think our lovers spat will start a little early this month.
Ill be waiting.
Now, this is last minute so I want to apologize for the mess. Okay?
Oh my God! It sure didnt look this way when I lived here.
I know!
Now look, theres only one problem though.
Theres only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joeys.
Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess  you should get to stay here.
Hey! Hey-hey, now this was no ones fault Pheebs. Okay? It was an accident.
Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room.
Okay!
So Rach!

Oh, you have been through so much.
I have.
This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.
Sorry, that was wax.
Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.
Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?
During a blackout? He'd get trampled!
Yeah?
Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this.
But I'll still always come back, like this.

How can I help you?
Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the Paleontology section?
See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.
We are aware of the problem you are referring to.
But as far as increasing security, Im afraid the library is very understaffed.
I, I cant help you.
Well, fine.
Fine!
If-if Im the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word, Ill go up there and defend it myself!
And dont you follow me!
Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain?
Oh my God! Phoebe look, its Ross and that girl.
No! No! Look at that!  Its a line of ants! Theyre working as a team!
Right, oh yeah.
Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is breaking up with her.

And now I have seen her naked.
I mean at least when Ive seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something.
But there are no boles, shes smooth!
Smooth!
Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?
Yeah! Oh my God!
So, you and Angela, huh?
Yep. Pretty much.

Yeah, most of it it's a place
Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET.
Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore on Madison    Avenue.
You know what?
She loves architecture, you know what you should do?
You should take a walk down fifth to the Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there    there's this great little pastry shop that she'd love.
Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!
But I'm not! . You know what if you're in the mood for    Thai food...
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, you go

Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you.
Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'...
Do you want a date Saturday?

Maybe you can tell me.
My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today.
The first good thing she gets me in weeks.
How could you not give me the message?
Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.
Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh!  Okay, it was me!
See Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed.
Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a guy have a crush on you?
Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?
Theres this kid in my class who said hes in love with me.

Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid!
I had a crush on a teacher once and it was so hard!

Guess who's here. It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben.  'A real American hero. I'm
G.I. Joe
Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!
It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.
That, that's what's stupid.
I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers.
And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.
Down at the docks again?
Hi there. How many, how many ah, did you sell?
Im not gonna tell you! Youre the bad man who broke Sarahs leg.
Hey now! That was an accident, okay.

You really sure?
Ill call you back.
So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him.
Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together.
But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary.
I am
I think you're better than you think you are.
Really? Okay, so
Know when to stop.
Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?
Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen.  Don't do the dance.

No. Not anymore.
Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood. Were you here waiting for me?
Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a party.
Barley? What kind of party serves barley?
Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.
Where is this party?
Here in Chelsea.
Who's party is it?
A woman's
What woman?!
Chelsea.
Either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet.
Or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle.
So like which of these two guys do you want to be?
Can I be that guy?
Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!
Yknow uh, actually I-I-I should get going.
Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay!
Wow. Oh, I am really flattered, but I just I dont feel that way about you.

Did you just flick me?
OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus- [Monica flicks her back] Ow. That hurt [flicks Monica]
Oh! All right. Now, let's not do this!
Happy thoughts! Happy thoughts!

Thats a great idea! We can
Totally!
We dont have to come up with this now.
Oh good.

Thats great. Good for you guys.
I am not high maintenance!
I am not a pushover!
Who said you were?
You did!
Oh, Im flaky. Ill say anything.
Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.
That does not sound stupid to me.
You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me?
I'm sorry, that's all the time we have.
Next on Ross... Uh-oh.
What uh-oh?
Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done.

Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh.
Ross, what's the matter?
Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done.
Why are you here?
Well, Sid and I are trying again and we had trouble last time    because apparently we...
No no no... I mean,

This was fun! But I've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to!
I'd love to stay, but I have eh...  got    a hot date...

I think it just fell off.
I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!
And I just want a million dollars!
Rachel?!
Yeah.
Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna let 'em!
And we're not a couple of suckers!
I hear ya, Mugsy!
But look, all these rooms are fine okay?
Can you just pick one so I can watch--have a perfect, magical weekend together with you.
Okay,
Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!
Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?
Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?
Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!
Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?
I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!
Do not speak ill of the dead.
We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?
I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom.
What did you say?
I said, "Geez, relax Monnnnn."

Yes.
Thanks man.
Okay man.
But what about how much taller he is than me?
I mean, theres no way I can make myself taller now, yknow?
And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?
Hey, Monica, wow youve been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.

Pheebs, what about you?
Oh... Milwaukee.
Um... Ross?
Disneyland, 1989, 'It's a Small World After All.'

The ride broke down.

Oh, Rachel.
Hey!
Hey!
Oh, is the play over?
Yeah. Where were you?

Hey, yknow what?
Since you have such a great sense of what I need, uh ooh, heres-heres 60 bucks, why dont you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.

Look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, I'm so
I'm not your brother.
What about my children Drake?! Huh!?  No!! No!! No! God!

Pizza, heh, its not like I never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh.
Is there something wrong?
All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay?
You're hot.
I'm lovable.
Clearly there's a vibe going on between us.
But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.
Joey...
Oh no its not, no its not. Its a first date. Im
Ho-oh, hes gonna get some!
Of the glare from the streetlight out of his apartment.
Yknow so umm, hes closed the drapes there so he can have a nice, pleasant conversation with your little sister.
Well, Im off to bed!
You were so funny with that waiter! You're such a nut!
Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny.

Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk.
Okay?
Umm, look I like you.

Aww, like I could hurt you. Are you making fun of my size? Don't make fun of me because of my size!
Oh, Joey! Sorry!

Yeah! Oh, and then afterwards you can take her to the
You sure are naming a lot of ways to postpone sex, Ill tell ya
Ooh, I miss dating.
Gettin all dressed up and going to a fancy restaurant.
Im not gonna be able to do that for so long, and its so much fun!
I mean not that sitting at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not fun.
Hey, yknow what?
Huh?
Why dont I take you out?
What?! Joey, you dont want to go on a date with a pregnant lady.
Yes I do!
And were gonna go out, were gonna have a good time, and take your mind off of childbirth and c-sections and-and giant baby heads stretching out
Okay! Ill go with ya! Ill go! Ill go with ya.
Ill be fun.
All right?
Hi!
Hey!
Joey, I gotta tell ya, I've been thinking
Oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good,    and... and my co-star's good
God, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow!
Ow, I'm just going over the script now! You wanna read lines with    me?
Me? Oh, no, I am not an actress.
Oh, all right, I can ask Monica.
Oh screw her, that part is mine!
Right...  ok, so just from the top of the page, right here.
Okay. . Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you    here.
I can't believe you married him.
But what choice did I have. He was keeping my sister    in a
So what about us? Everything we feel for each other.
It's over! You
How can I?
Knowing I'll never hold you in my arms again,    or touch your skin, or feel your lips, knowing I'll never make love to you?
How can I accept that...
I can never kiss you again when it's all I can do not    to kiss you right now.
Kiss me.
What?
Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?
The bigger half.
I'd like to propose a toast.
Little toast here, ding ding.
I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting.
Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know?
So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
That's so sweet.
And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
And a crappy New Year.
Here, here!
Now, hold on!
Hold on!
Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that Im gonna be at that airport and I hope that shell be there too!
Oh yeah, I said Rachels name, but it didnt mean anything, Okay?
Shes-shes just a friend and thats all!
Thats all!
Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I cant imagine spending my life with anyone else.
Please, promise me that youll tell her that.
All right, Ill tell her.  Come on bugger face!

You spend half your life in the bathroom, why dont you ever go out the bloody window!
What happened?!!
Well, I dont know!!
We fell asleep! That is all.
Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, Id better go.
I think that would be best.
Yeah. All right, Ill talk to you later.
Okay. But not about this!
No! Never! Never!  Bye.
No touch! No touch!
Umm maam, do you have a minute?  I kind of have some bad news. I dont think I can move to Tulsa.
What?
Its a funny story, actually.
I kind of fell asleep  in the meeting this morning so when I said Id move to Tulsa, I didnt really  know what I was saying.
You fell asleep?
But only because I was up all night worried about this  meeting, aint that funny?
Irony?
Not a fan, alright .
See, heres  the thing.
I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she wont go.
See, me, I  love Tulsa!
Tulsa is heaven!
Tulsa is ItalyPlease dont make me go  there!

Ill call you from Tulsa.
Hi.
Hey.
How are you?
I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How-how did you know I was here?
Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.
That I was not expecting.
I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.
Oh. Thanks.
No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing
Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'.
I just can't believe you're in here.
I mean, what am I gonna do without you?
Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me?
Who's gonna take me to the
Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.
What do you mean?
Smell familiar?
Oh no.
Oh, I am so sorry.
No me, I am so sorry...
Oh my.
Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot.
Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun.
Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles.
Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?
My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally.
No, under these circumstances it has to be an injection, and it has to be now.
Tho?

Thanks for picking out the earrings man.
Mm-Hm
I know that theres no hole there, I just really liked that picture.
Oh my God! Look at this!
Okay, but there
I dont care! The wires have come loose in your head!
I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.
And did you?!
No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs.
But it didnt. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.
Oh my God.
Hello darling.
Hello, Mrs. Chatracus.

I-I am so sorry, Ill go.
Good-bye Monica , I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him.
Chandler,  you call me when this goes in the pooper.
I found my identical hand twin!
Ohh, you are
No!
But she just came up here!
That was Joey!
I wonder where she is. That is so weird.
Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard.
Would you stop that!
Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she came back from her lunch with Richard?
She didn't feel anything for him.
She loves you!
Really?
Yes! Now, she feels terrible! She really wants to make up! You gotta find her.
Okay.
Good.  I should really start wearing hats!
I mean, why should I let them meet him?
I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him.
I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.
Listen.
As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing.
I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you.
I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.
Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy..
No-no-no-no.  Hey!
Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye.
Hey sweetie.
Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?
I cant tell you. Its a secret.
Secret? Married people arent supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.
Awww.  But still no.
No Im serious, we should tell each other
Really? Okay, so why dont you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at
Oh no-no, I cant do that.
If you tell me, Ill tell you what Phoebe said.

Oh please! It was such a big class! You never even noticed me!
What? Of course I did! You uh, you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson.

Umm, no. No.
Yes you did! What was it?
Umm, its Cutie McPretty.
Ohh thats so sweet!
Listen, I gotta tell ya, I-Im having a great time!

I mean its not at all.
Dr. Geller!
Burt!
Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on.
Okay, shoot.
Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial.
I didn't get it?
No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can work on that.
Okay, what else?
Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb.'
Oh.
Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'
Hey.
How's the maniac?
Oh, well he's yummy. We did a little kissin'.
Phoebe, what are you doing?
Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He quit for me.
Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how long, okay, you don't just give up something like that.
Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.
You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?
What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her?
Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.
What are you saying I should do?
I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.
Thank you, Monica.
Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.
Oh, that's what I would do, forget mine.
Hey guys check it out! My mom sent me the paper!
Ooh, lets see it!
Shes not crazy is she?
No.
So uh, how you doin?
There he is!

No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second.  That's my friend's machine.
Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it.
Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it.

So do you think that these picturesAre, are they trying to tell a story?
Oh, yeah, sure.
I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, shes crying out, Where are they, where are they?
Well, shes not going to find them lying in the grass like that.
Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?
Yeah.
You see, now, I would date this girl.
Shes cute, shes outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire.

And shame on you!
And shame on all of you!
Youre disgusting!
Especially you  with that!
Hey!
Hi Pheebs!
Are you moving out?
No, these aren't all my suitcases.  This one's Paolo's.
Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?
Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over.
Oh!  Ok, um, ok, um,
Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs...
Ok, um,  we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me.
One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.
Ok, thanks Pheebs  Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!
Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies
All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.
Which proves that I never lie.
I guess you don't.
Paolo made a pass at me.
Im so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.
Im not freaking out.
Why would I be freaking out?
A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday.
Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun!
I mean, whats the harm in that?
Right here!
Chandler, please dont think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel
Phoebe and Rachel!
So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!
It was a mistake. Please dont take this to mean anything, because it doesnt.
Okay.
Really?
Yes, if it really doesnt mean anything, because you know that Im just not ready
I know! I know.
Okay.
Im gonna go tell Joey that  that youre back. I was really worried about you.
Hey, did she buy it?
Totally.
So did Heldi show you the place?
Yeah, its beautiful.
I cant believe youre gonna ask Monica to marry you!
I know.
Okay look, I have an idea.
Why dont we, why dont we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him.
And then whoever does gets the phone.
All right, first name on the speed dial is mom.
Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.
Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.
Did I use that already today? Im sorry.
Joe.
Oh, I win! Hes got
So you dont know thats
His new girlfriend!
I cant believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?
I dont know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding.
Shes saving the rest for her divorce.
And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to
Well what happened at dinner?
My parents spent the money for our wedding!
My God! What did you order?!
Wait, but theres no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!
Honey, its gonna be okay.
No! No its not! Its not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!
No, yknow what?
Its gonna be okay.
I mean you dont have to have this rustic Italian feast.
Yknow?
And-and you dont need, you dont need this custom-made, empire-waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack.
Dr. Geller, theres a seat over here.
Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but Im having my lunch at this table, here in the middle.
Im having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if hell sit with me.
I will sit with you Dr. Geller.
Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch.
Now, I look around this cafeteria, and yknow what I see, I see-I see division.
Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself, "My God why?!"
Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath.
Im Ross!
Im divorced, and I have a kid!
Im Joey! Im an actor! I dont know squat about dinosaurs!
Im Ted, and I just moved here a month ago, and New York really scares me.
All right, there you go!
Yeah, you hang in there Teddy!
Im Andrew, and I didnt pay for this pear.
Okay, good-good for you.
Im Rhonda,  and these arent real!
Wow, Rhonda.
Im Scott.
Yeah, okay, Scott!
And I need to flip the light switch on and off 17 times before I leave a room or my family will die.
So thanks for the warm welcome.
Its good to have you guys on my team, and I come to play.

This team is about hard work, but its also about having fun.
Good to have you aboard Bing!
Yeah. You won't be able to take it.
So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?
They're gonna call her Chandler.
That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?
Works on you.
Oh, that is so sweet.
No, no, ok, you hang up.
Ok, ok, one, two, three.
Well you didn't hang up either.
She didn't hang up either...
Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y

Well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you.
OK, I need to lie down.
Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!
Really? That's great!
I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her
(noticing a kid who has picked up a copy of
Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks,
Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one.
Ben is way cuter than that kid.
I mean look at him, look at you,
That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?
Joey, you look nothing like Ben.
I look more like him than you do!
Y'know, I don't really know you well enough for you to do that.
That really was some of your best work.
Hm-hmm, I told you!  I cant believe that Ive only got two hours before I call in sick for work.
I have to be up in seven minutes.
Well, youre not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes
Really?!
Do you wanna?
Okay! You get the vacuum cleaner and Ill get the furniture polish!
Oh okay. But yknow what? Be careful. Because a guy who was helping me before had to leave because he hurt his back.
Boyfriend?
No.

Kristen.
Oh wow, what a beautiful name!  What is it again?
Kristen.
Got it!  So
So uh, do you live around here?

Ill remember that.
Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
Oh I, I have plans tonight.
But how about tomorrow?
Sounds great! Okay, alright, well where does this go?
You look strong, why dont I take that and you grab one of the boxes.
Okay. Yeah.  Yeah, Ill grab this one.
Hey.
Listen, um...
I'm sorry.
: Yeah, um...  You know you, you should just forget about what I said under the bridge, I was talkin'
That's right, I don't... But I was, I was drunk on you!
Okay, yeah, so it's not gonna work.
If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?
Um, then yes, it's 'cause of Phoebe! So, you know, it's either her or me.
You know...  You're gonna be really, really hard to get over.
By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me.
Oh, hello liar.
Look, I-Im really sorry I let go of the bike.
I couldve been killed I hope you know!
I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were
Well, I would love to butthe bike got stolen and the police have no suspects.
Phoebe.
What?!  What the hell?!
All right, yknow what?
If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then Im sorry, Im just gonna have to take it back.
What?! Why?!
Because! Because, it-it-its Itd be like you having this guitar  and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar
All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.
Great! Great!  Youre making the bike very happy.
Okay Ross!  Please dont die!
How could you have kept all of this from me?
I was going to tell you, but
But what?! You figured youd get what you wanted and then dump her like you dumped Rachel!
Hey! I did not dump Rachel!  Nor are we still together.  Can I just  Why dont we just let the machine get that?
Hey Ross. Its Joey. Theres a hooker over here and we thought maybe youd know something about it.
No! No! No! No! No! I-I-I-II need to, I need to lie down.
Everything on your application looks really goodOhh!
Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?
Oh dont worry, Im not really a party girl.
Whoa!! Now look, dont be just blurtin stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?
You can call off the roommate search!  Hi! Ill be living here.
Oh dont listen to him, hes just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I dont think hes gonna get it.
Why did you take the shower curtain down?
That thing was a hazard!  Im very safety conscious.
Hi.
Hey man, how did the audition go?
Estelle said I didn't get it.
What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!
Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me.
No!
For all I know, shes trying to find me but couldnt because I kept moving around.
No, from now on, Im staying in one place.
Right here.
Well, its getting late.
Yeah, were gonna go.
Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?
Ugh, yknow, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.
Yeah, its a very large plane.
Thats cool.
But, well stay here with you.
Thanks guys!  I really appreciate this, yknow, but you dont have to rub my butt.
Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.
Theyre not a couple!
Oh-okay, I get the game now.
Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?
Oh yeah!
Well okay, so then youre fine.
The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone.
Okay?
So as long as its hot onstage you got nothing to worry about.
Its when the heat goes away, thats when youre in trouble.
Really?
Look, you guys have been to every play Ive ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?
No.
Noooo!!
Ursula!  Wait! Err-err, its me! Phoebe!
Oh, I thought there was a mirror there. Okay, bye-bye.
Wait a second! So, whats new with you?
Umm, nothing. I mean, Im getting married next week.
And your breasts! Hmm!!!
Okay.
Umm look, youre coming on a little strong.
But Im going to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to be together.
So, why dont we just start over okay?
And you can just tell me about yourself.
All right.
Okay.
I write erotic novels, for children.
What?!
Theyre wildly unpopular.
Oh my God!
Oh also, you might be interested to know that I have a Ph.D.
Wow! You do?
Yeah,  a Pretty Huge
All right.
So, uh, how's she doing?
The doctor says it's a matter of hours.
How-how are you, Mom?
Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ...What's with your hair?
What?
What's different?
Nothing.
Oh, maybe that's it.
She is unbelievable, our mother is...
Okay, relax, relax.
We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.
Oh God!
The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.
Oh!
...Yeah, they were gross.
Oh, you know what I loved?
Her Sweet 'n' Los.
How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.
Not just restaurants, from our house.
Maybe.
You can't!
Why?  Seriously I did not understand a word that    you said.
In the hall.
Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping.
But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose.
Like, chasing their tail,  or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.
Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.
That's a good one!
Hey, Joe.
Dad, Ronni's here.
Huh?
So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if theres anything that you like, we can make you a deal.

Well, thanks a lot for hookin me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.
Im Monicas maid of honor. Okay? Dont try to blue pin me!
Oh here, I think this is us.  Yeah.

Stop saying, "Blood" to strangers.
So, how about you huh? How do you know the happy couple?
Okay, youre fine.
Monica, why have you brought me here of all places?!
Youll see.
I tell you, this wedding is not going to happen.
Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and yknow fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles
And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay? And the chairs can face this way , and  You go.
But-but, if you dont love this, well do it in any other place at any other time.
Really, its fine, whatever you want.

And, I dont know, if it starts to rain
Well then well get wet.
Ohh. And I dont even have a date.

Yknow what? It doesnt matter! Because it is not true!
Okay.
And if it were true, how
Ms. Monroe  Oh there you go.
Mark's a genius!
Why?! How?! How is he a genius?
Look, don't you see what's happening here.
Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant.
Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.
What am I going to do?
Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that.
All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.
I don't know you guys.
All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you.
And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'
And before you know it, she's with him.
And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!'
And he'll be all, 'Yes!'
And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.'
And pretty soon you'll be like,  'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.'
And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'
He paints quite a picture doesn't he?
This is what Ive got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a lot of liquor.
Great. Great.
Okay, now uh, in terms of the invite list, Ive got you, me, and Chandler and Im gonna invite Gunther cause, well, weve been talking about this pretty loud.
Ill be there.
Listen, I know this is your party, but Id really like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there.

Okay! Well need a six-pack of
Hey guys, what are you doing?
Hey, yknow what, if youre gonna do that, if youre gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler.
Oh, come on!
Chandlers funny, sophisticated, and hes very loveable, once you get to know him.
Oh well, hey, Joeys loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, hell be there.
Well, Chandler will be there for you too.
I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, hell be there.
And hell bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that youre really hot.
What do ya say? What do ya say?
Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names.
But, all right, I dontmaybe Ill just name him The Hulk.
I knew I shouldnt have mentioned it! Thats what I wanted to name my kid!
What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.
I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!
Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...
What's that supposed to mean?
Nothing! It's an expression.
No it's not.
Don't listen to your mother.
You're independent, and you always have been!
Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine!
And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...
PBS Telethon.
Hi Joey.
Hey Pheebs!
I
$200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what
Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not
What kind of problem?
Well to tell you the truth, they uh,  they had a problem with the bag!
Oh my God!
Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!
Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag.
I don't wanna give up the bag.
I don't have to give up the bag!
Do I Rach?
Oh, you think I should give up the bag!
Honey wait, Joey, Im sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it
I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
I can't believe I'm hearing this!
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
I'm not saying that you shouldnt have a bag, I justit's just there are other bags that are a little less umm,  controversial.
Yeah umm, they're called wallets.
I think you'll find this room more to your liking.
Okay, great.
They say he's only got half a tank left.
Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
We're switching rooms again.
What? Why?
This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.
Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you.
Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?
Uh-huh.
Chandler!
Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!!
Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey!!
Oh. Oh, did-did-did I wake you?
Hey!
Hey! Oh, I was just about to leave. I-I-I-I didnt think you were coming.
Oh, I wouldnt miss this.
Well, Im very glad youre here.
Oh, youre such a gentleman.  Come on! Were going to my place!
Hey!
Hey-hey.
So are guys doing okay?
Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important.
Do you have a minute?
Well yeah, sure, whats up?
I got asked out twice today when I was at lunchby guys.
Oh really?!
Yeah. Did you tell someone that I was gay?
Oh, did you not want people to know that?
But Im not gay. And I especially wouldnt want you to think I was gay.
Whys that?
I dont think I should say.
Ohh, you can say. Come on, I dont want you to feel like you cant tell me things.
Okay.
Kay.
Well
Yeah.
Id love to ask out your friend Phoebe.
Yeah, shes gay.
Here you go.
Great! All right, so Ill call you later.
Great!
Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?
That would be Casey. Were going out tonight.
Goin out, huh? Wow! Wow!  So things didnt work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.
No, things are fine with Kathy. Im having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.
What?
Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!
Wait! Youre going out with Kathy!
Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?
Well, Im upsetfor you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.
What is the big deal? Its not like were exclusive.
Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs.
But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that shes-shes smart, and funny, and gets you.
You got all that from the back of her head?
All right look, I think its time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.
Whos Elaine?
Can you people not see me?!
So, will you talk to him?
I dont know Rach.
Oh, come on! Ill give you ten free
One!  No ten! You said ten! You cant take that back!
Hey!
Hi!
Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television?
We need a porn break.
We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.
Well, so, why dont you just turn it off?
Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.
Ooh, good, youre hear! Okay.
Hey!
Hi!
Well, what-what cha got there?
Oh this, well Im glad you asked.
Now, dont you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife?
Ahh!
Now, I know what youre thinking
Pregnant Woman Slays Four?
Phoebe, they didnt make you pay for those knives, did they?
No!
Honey, youre not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives.
No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.
Whats the second part of your plan?
Yes thats right.
Why?
I tired attacking two women, did not work.
What?!
No, I mean its okay, I mean, theyre-theyre my friends.
In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them.
Let me get this straight man, you attacked your ex-wife?!
Oh, no!
No-no!
No, I tired!
But I couldnt.
Thats why Im here.
Maybe we could attack them together?
That-thats a no.
What? No! No, Im not stopping. Im Red Ross!
Dude, if you go back out there, youre gonna be Dead Ross!
I dont care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!
All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you.
No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.
No. Thats not what Im saying. I just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain.
I like that.
Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle.
Huh?
One swift kick and hell back off.
All right, bad ankle, got it!
And that big bloke with the beard, he has got a trick hip.
Yeah.
And uh, and David over there, I heard he doesnt wear a cup.
Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay!
And uh, Liam, Liams got bad knees. You hit him right and hell go down like a lamp.
But-but, Liams on my team.
I dont care! You just get him!
Im gonna go get him! Okay, I am going back in!
The Red Ross! Okay.
Oh!  Oh by the way?
Uh-hmm.
James Brolin?
Oh, I know. I could only think of two names, him and Ed Begley Jr. and then I remembered hes gay.
Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.
Really?!
Hello?
Hello, is Ross there?
Uh no, hes not. Can I take a message?
Yes, this Russell, Rosss divorce lawyer, just tell him that since I havent heard from him, I assume hes decided to give the marriage a try.
Ross got married againNooooooo!!!!!!!!!
Oh-oh! Okay, shes kicking!
Oh!  Shes growing inside you.
Whoa!!
Oh!
Wow that was a big one.
I think thats the youngest girl ever to reject me.
Oh hey you guys!
Sure, I can hang out til I have to meet ya.  What uhHow come youre not going?
I have a job interview I have to get ready for.
I thought you already have a job.
And people say you dont pay attention.
No, this is a much better job.
Its vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies.
Wow! How do you know how to do that?!
Thats what I do now.
Hey Joey, come taste this.
What is it?
Remember that guy that gave me a bad review? Well  Im getting my revenge!
You cooked him?
No.
He teaches a course on food criticism at the New School, so before we go to the movies I wanna go by there and make him try my bouillabaisse again.
Oh, I cannot wait to read the front page of the Post tomorrow!
"Restaurant reviewer admits: I was wrong about Monica."
The front page? You really do live in your own little world, dont ya?
So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?
No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together.
Were never gonna find anybody.
Well then let me do it!
Joe
No-no-no!
Look, Ive been thinking about it.
Im an actor right?
So I wont get nervous talking in front of people.
I wont spit, and I wont stare at Monicas breasts!
Everyone knows Im an ass man!
That is true.
Yeah and the most important thing is that it wont be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you.
Itll be me!
And I swear Ill do a really good job.
Plus, yknow I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.
It might be kinda cool.
So I can do it?
Ah-ha! Too cocky!
I still cant believe they took away my key. You trust me with yours.
Of course I do! And Im gonna give it back to you as soon as theyre done with it at the key shining place.
What the hell is that?
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing?
You said there was a gas leak in here.
Well why dont you use your key?
Because by the time I find it on this thing , the whole place might have exploded.
If that happens at another building that I manage, people are gonna start asking questions.
Come on!
Hurry up.
Oh! We could have done that.
Luckily, the guy she settled for cant hear what youre talking about.
Oh, Im so sorry.
Um, and maybe Im wrong!
I butyknow Im gonna go out with him again, Ill find out more.
You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and youre still gonna date him?
Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girls gotta eat.
Oh, but its made her so happy.
Little girl misses her cat.
Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat.
Okay, y'know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her.
Yeah.
Thank you.
I
He is right, isnt he?
Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times hes wrong.
You think?
Oh-no, hes right.
Seven hundred bucks!
Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?
Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.
Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?
What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this?
Oh.
Y'know those are a delicacy in India.
Me too.
Although this city is my home, so.
So thats dumb what I said, dont tell him I said that.
Umm, you make something up.
Nice,  thank you.
This is me.

Your eyes are very pretty.
Thank you, very much! Oh!  Thank you!
He would like to kiss you.
Okay, y'know what, you dont have to do that now.
No-no-no-no!!
Not him, you dont!
Well the moments over.
Oh.

Oh-ho, I think its nice.
Well you have to because maybe its stupid.
Well its just while Monica and I were dancing to them it wasthe first time I knew thatyou were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.
Oh crap!
All right.
The super couldnt figure out what it did.
A $200 an hour electrician couldnt figure out what it did.
Ive had seven pretty serious shocks.
I officially give up.
Thank God.
I guess Joey was right, it does nothing.
See? Im doing it. I am totally doing it.  I lost it.
Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
He doesn't have anyone.
Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.
I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.
Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up!
Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book, 'Euphoria Unbound': the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing.
You might wanna put the kids to bed for this one.
Y'know, we don't have to watch this.
No way, forget it.
C'mon, she's your mom!
Exactly.
Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books!
I love her books!
I cannot get on a plane without one!
I mean, this is so cool!
Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'
C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.
Thank you.
And a nice hot cider for Monica.
Aww, thank you.  Uh Rach?
Yeah?
Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?
Oh! That's why.  I'm sorry!
Oh. Oh! Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am?
You can't put your cigarette out on a tree!
Yeah I can, it worked real well.
No but you shouldn't! Don't ever do that again.
I won't!  Until I have my next cigarette.
Hold it!  N.Y.P.D! Freeze punk!

Hi!
Hi!

Uh-huh.
You must be Bens mum.
Why else would I be here?
Do sit down.
Yeah.
Hi.. how was the game?
Well..
WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!
Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?
Alan.
He was unbelievable.
He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...
I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.
Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..
Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..
What?
..I dunno, a little too Alan?
Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.
Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.
I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
Well I had a great time! Learned how to bake, ate great food, thats the first A Ive gotten since seventh grade,
Oh, look! Acting for Beginners! Want to feel good about yourself?
What the hell!
Okay.
All right, lets start with some basics. Can anybody tell me what the difference between upstage and downstage is?
Yeah, this was a stupid idea.
My God!
These pants are burning up!
Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now!
What is she trying to kill me?
It's like a volcano in here!
Are you hot?
Okay, it must just be me then.
That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I use your bathroom?
You're driving me crazy with that!
Okay, I'll stop.
Dont stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!
Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.
You wanna play?
Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon.
And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.
Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.
All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?
I'm intrigued.
All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.
Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.
Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.
Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
Uh yeah, right here.
Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends?  Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch?
What's that?
Weeeell, it's rum, and-
I'm sure they'll be here soon.
Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this.
Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.
You are really frightening me.
Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart.  Uh, that's great.  Anybody seen a nipple?
All right, ten centimeters, here we go.
All right, honey, time to start pushing.
But they're not here yet!
I'm sorry, I can't tell the baby to wait for them.
Oh, god.

I dont know exactly.
Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.
But I do know that its some time tomorrow.
Ooh, this is it!  Oh, thats him! Thats him!
Great! Go get him.
Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first.
Hes not really my type.
No not you, Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see whats he like. People tell doctors everything.
But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn out to be the biggest jerks.
You do attract some stinkers.
Chandler.
Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a
Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.
Oh, listen.
If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them.
Really.
Nothing at all.
Really.
Nothing.
Yknow when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?
Of course! Joey wouldnt let you have one?
No. When it comes to sweets, hes surprisingly strict.
Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him youre moving out?
No, no, I keep trying, yknow?
I can get out, "Joey, I have too" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "go to the bathroom."
He may think Im sick.
Yknow, I really have to tell Rachel, but I We just have to get it over with!
Yknow, the next time we see them were just gonna tell them.
Thats it.
Oh, so thats this is gonna work now? Youre just gonna order me around all the time?
Pretty much.
All right.
Hey Monica!
Hi!
Hey man, you feeling any better?
Joey, we have something to tell you.
Oh my God! Youre pregnant!
Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, youre only married in Vegas.
What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas youre married everywhere.
Really?!
Yeah!
Oh my God!Eh! Well
You see that guy? Hes in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave hes going straight to the porn.
Hes gonna go up to the counter with
Yeah.
I missed this.
Me too.
So, you wanna get a hamburger or something?
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Awww!
Hey, its your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.
We will.
Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles.
No Mon,
Every year.
Hey! Ross!
Die Hard
Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?
Whatd you rent?
Die Hard 2
Joey, this is
Oh, well we watch it a second time and its
Joey, we
And?
And itll be cool to see it again! Yeah!
Die Hard
Dude, you didnt say
Yeah, I just got uh, got plans.
Well, John McClane had plans!
No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.
What are you talking about? Bitch.
I know you botched that operation on purpose.
I can't prove    it yet, but when I do, you'll be going to jail for murder.
I don't care if you    are my brother.
Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium    in the Devonian era was top notch!
Stop going through my stuff !
Hey!
Hey!
I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna    do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey.
No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea.
Please, what about you and Chandler?
That's different! I was drunk and stupid!
Well hello !
What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from?    Why don't you just kiss one of them?
I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!
Alright . I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.
I'm gonna do it.
And I can't stop you.
No.
Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere?
I'm smarter than
Oh, hey, Gunther, check this out.
Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up.
Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, cause Im heading up there.
Uh, yeah, Ill take a coffee. Thanks, man.
Sure.  Coffee? Cause Im going up there.
No.
No, thank you.
You guys need anything, cause Im heading up there.
Id love an ice water.
You got it.
Joey, what are you doing?
Just being friendly.
Joey, honey, I dont think youre supposed to go back there.
Nah, its okay. Right, Gunther?
Dont wink at me. And put on your apron.
Okay, but I dont see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.
Joey, do you work here?
No.
Hey, waiter.
Yeah?
Youve reached Monica and Chandlers, if youre listening to this message, were probably screening.  Yeah we are.
Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum.
Im calling for Monica Geller.
I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if shes still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available
This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!  Yes, the groomNo! Not the groom!!
Thank you.
Thanks.
I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!
Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler.  I am
This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again.
So go fix it!
Go find Chandler!
He's probably up in your room!
Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.
Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you!
Sure!   Yeah! Las Vegas, number one!
Anybody lose this?
Comin' out. Place your bet.  Dice are out.  Double or nothin'! Pay the front line!
Hmm.
Do you remember where the duck food is?
Yeah, its in the guys apartment under the sink. Why?
Because Im going to London.
What?! What do you mean youre going to London?
Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him.
Now honey, you take care, you dont have those babies until I get back.
IRachel, you cant go! Ross loves Emily!
Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does.
But I have to tell him how I feel!
He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.
Thats not why youre going!
Youre going because you hope hes gonna say, "Yeah, I love you too, Rach.
Forget that British chippy."
OhhDo you think he will?!
No!
Because hes in love with the British chippy!
Look, Rachel, if you go, youre just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding!
Yknow, its too late!
You missed youre chance!
Im sorry, I know this must be really hard, its over.
Yknow what? No. Its not over until someone says, "I do."
I do! I do! I do!  I do!  Ugh, like I can really chase you. Im carrying a litter.
So is everybody here?
I got here a little early myself.
Let us begin.
Now, the hydrosaurids have been unearthed in two main locations.
Here.
Here.
Now as for the hydrosaurs
Well, so anyway Beth, what Im saying is I shouldve considered your feelings before I went home with you that night.
Ive ah, Ive recently learned whats it like to be on your side of it, and Im sorry.
So, do you think you can forgive me?
Great.
Thanks.
Okay, bye.
Hello, Jennifer?
Oh hi, Mrs. Loreo, is Jennifer there?
Oh, shes not home huh?
Well ah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.
Hey!
Hi.
Are you all right?
Uhh I think I just got engaged.
Oh my God! He did it?
Welldid you know he was gonna ask me?
Are you kidding?
Im like the one who talked him into it.
I  like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.
And you really think this is a good idea?
I just talked him into it, dont tell me I have to do you too.  The puppet master gets tired people.
I just dont know! It just doesnt feel right.
Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks  so.
Really?! Even Ross?
Especially Ross!
Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh yknow what? Ill-Ill come  back later.
Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. Ill guess justIll  come back.
There he goes, your fiance.
I guess so.
Although he does play with himself in his sleep.
I cant say that Im surprised.
Oh, that is so unfortunate.
What?
Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.
Okay, Ill be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe Im sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone.
You didnt leave lipstick marks on the phone.
Oh, then it mustve been you. Bye.
Bye-bye!  Thats why I moved out.
Hey, y'know while were on that, when are you gonna tell my sister that you dont live here anymore.
I think on some levels she already knows.
Night Mon. Night Julio.
Adis.
Look Julio, someone left their book here.
Ah actually, that is mine.
Oh yeah, what are you reading?
Flowers of Evil, by Beaudalire. Have you read it?
Have I read it?  No, are you enjoying it?
I thought I would, but the translation's no good.
Your a poet and don't know it.
Actually I ah, I am a poet.
Oh, then you do know it.  So um what kind of things do you write about?
Things that move me. The, the shadow of a tree, a child laughing, or this lip.
Mine?  Right here?
I can write an epic poem about this lip.
How would that go?  Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it.
Last stop, Montreal. This stop is Montreal.
What?
I made a bet with myself that you have beautiful eyes. Now that I see them, I win.
What?
Were at my stop. But would you like to have coffee?
Are we really in Montreal?!
Yes we are. So, coffee?
Coffee sounds great.  Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?
Oh, no. But its just a two hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia.
Okay, heres batch 22.
Oh, maybe thesell taste a little like your grandmothers.
This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.
Lets give it a shot.
Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?
No, just a Friday night.
Would she?
Would she?  You ate my candy bar!
Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.
I know honey, Im sorry.
Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because its remotely related to the field theyre interested in.
Gee, I dont know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!
Oh honey, come on, Im sorry, I didnt....
I dont mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom.
Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?
Im sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah....
Its not funny, this is actually my job.
Oh believe me, I-I-Ive been there. I had to sort mannequin heads at that Mannequins Plus.
Oh well then, so Im just going to go back to talking to my friend here.
And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.
Ah, just one other thing.
Yes?!
I ah, I work at
Do you want my pickle?
Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?
Why?
Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.
Oh my God.
Phoebe.
Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.
Where?  Ooh, come to Momma.
He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.
We should do something. Whistle.
We are not going to whistle.
Come on, do it.
No!
Do it!
No!
Do it do it do it!
Woo-woo!
I can't believe you did that!
Hi! Umm, Im Monica Geller, Im the chef at Alessandros.
Still?
I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I would like for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance.
I dont see any reason why I would do that to myself again.
Either eat it, or be in it.
Spoon?  So, what do you think?
Im torn, between my integrity and my desire to avoid a beating. But I must be honest, your soap is abysmal.
Thata girl! Huh? We should get out of here.. theres a new class comin in.
Welcome to introduction to cooking. Now, before we start, can anyone tell me the difference between a hollandaise sauce and a bearnaise sauce?
I can.
Okay, go ahead.
Well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a bearnaise has shallots, shirvel, and most importantly tarragon.
Thats very good, whats your name?
Monica.
Monica, you go to the head of the class.
Okay.
And there's a country called Argentinaaaa,    it's a place I've never seeeeen.
But I'm told for fifty pesos you can buy a    human spleen.
Human spleeeen.
Ol!
What are you doing here!
Well, you said that you had customers lined up in the street,    so I am here to entertain!
Great!
Yeah!
It really has been great too, you know, some of this people    must have seen me play before because they were requesting a bunch of my songs!
Yeah, "You suck" and "shut up and go home".
Listen Phoebe...
Yeah.
You know how much I love listening to your music, you know,    but...
But what?
This is kind of a classy place.
Ok, say no more.
I'm so bored! Stupid rain, we... we can't do anything.
Well, I've brought some books. We could read.
Hey, it hasn't come to that yet.
Hey hey hey! Don't mind if I do!
I'm sorry sir, these are for the pharmaceutical convention
Hey Rach, do you feel like going to a convention?
We can't. We're not pharmacists!
I know we're not, but  Frank Medeio and...  Eva Trorro... womba...
Kate Miller?
Kate Miller it is.
And... that's the most sex I'm gonna have this weekend.
In that case should I make sure it's on real good?
Thank you.
Oh my God!
We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry.
This year was supposed to be great!
But, it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!
No. No, you're not a loser.
Look at me!
Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you!  Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!
Oh, be-because of the leather pants.
See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now that's something.
That really is something.. that's really cool.
Howdy partner!
Maybe I should get another pair!
Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with fringe all down the sides.
I'm gonna go kiss Ben goodnight.
I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy.
I would make a good cowboy.
Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry.
Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty.  Yep.
No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!
Oh yeah!
Great nap.
It really was.
Uh me? Gay? No! No. No, but I have a number of close friends who are.
So, lets talk about women. Im sure our female readers will be interested to know about your romantic life.
Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, "Hey, how you doin?"
Oh, please!
Hey, how you doin?
Hey Mikey
Hey P
What are you doing?
Setting rattraps
To kill Bob??
No, no, to test his neck strength.
No, Mike, I don't want to kill him!
I thought we were just gonna    capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can    maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl.
Ok, ok, I'll throw away the traps.
I'll find Bob, I'll get him.
Bob?
Bob!
Robert!
Oh wait, I think I hear him.
Oh - Oh my god!
Bob    had babies!
Bob's a mom!
Better think of a new name for him.
I don't know, I kinda like Bob for a girl.
I don't know, I mean I'm not sure  ...
Oh my god, we killed Bob!
Maybe it wasn't Bob, maybe it was a mouse.
Suzie
Hmmm, soup!
Joey, Ross is gonna be here any second, would you mind watching Ben for me while I use the ladies' room?
Oh yeah, no problem.
Thanks.
Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection.
Joey!
What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!
Yeah, but he waited until the last minute!
So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party.
I said, "No!"
Which puts
Great. So the ball is in his court?
Ball? There is no ball.
Oh, hey Rach! I thought we said seven?
Yeah uh, y'know what uh, let's skip it.
What?! Why?!
Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and
Oh great! That
Do-do you, do you have brothers?
No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy.
Are you close with them?
No-no, they're not very nice people.
Okay, listen, I really like you.
Okay?
I think this can go somewhere.
So what if I'm close to my family, are you gonna let that stand in the way of us?
Well, uh, I-I don't know. See when-when you put it that way y'know it does sort of
Danny! Hurry up! The bath is getting cold!

Anyway, she didnt want to stay.
I called a cab. she just left.
I wrote you a letter.
Ohh! Thank you! I like mail.

Well, you said that we except the
All right, that Ill retract.

You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
Hey! Im proud of that sauce, its delicious.
Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?
Lebanon.
Hand me those tomatoes, Im gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them.

Oh wow thats a great idea! And
Here you go.
Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one.
Here you go.
Yknow I gotta tell ya, sometimes I justI dont get Chandler.

All the time?
All the time!
Cassie, how you-how you doin on thathot dog.
Im all done.
Thank God.
I guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented that beach house together.
Oh right.
Right.
Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and tickled you til you cried?
Were probably too old to do that now.
Ill always remember that summer, because its when I got all of these freckles.
Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and Ill always remember that summer because thats when I realized that we are related.
It took you that long to figure it out, huh?
Well Im, Im a little slow.  Just as our children would be.
Relax every muscle in your body.
Listen to the plinky-plunky music.
Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place.
Okay, tell me your happy place.
Richard's living room, drinking wine.
All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And get out!
I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.
Well, okay, fine, use my happy place.
Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to ask that you don't move anything.
All right, I'll try not to.
Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky....
Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?
All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....
I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.
All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place.
Okay.
Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains.
And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....
Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.
OK sweetie, I'll see you later.
See you later Rach.
Bye-bye Julie.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey, c'mon, cut it out.
Hey?
What?
Can I ask you somethin'?
Hey Rach, wanna hear the new song I'm thinkin' of singing this afternoon? I wrote it this morning in the shower.
Ok.
Uh, Rachel, sweetheart, could I see ya for a minute?
What's up?
F.Y.I..
I've decided to pay a professional musician to play in here on Sunday afternoons.
Her name is Stephanie... something.
She's supposed to be very good.
But what about Phoebe?
Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad, she makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around.
Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her.
Uh...
Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?
Ahh, no.
Oh.
Are you jealous?
Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all.
I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?
You are totally jealous.
I'm not jealous.
All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers.
And y'know, and um, I...
Honey, I love you too.
Ugh. Wait, wait, wait.
What?
Huh.
Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know.
Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.
I cant believe you came back.
Dont say anything.
I dont wanna speak, I dont wanna think.
I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now.
Rachel! Rachel!
What?
You missed the exit!
Oh, sorry.
My God, what were you thinking about?
Um,  Barry.
Awwwww
I justI thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!
Dude!
And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor.  And might I say your breasts are still showing.
God!
All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
Well actually, Ross doesn't.
Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
Dear Mary-Angela.
Hi.
How?s it going.
This is the hardest letter I?ve ever had to write.
What the hell?s a matter with you?
How do you think Joey?s going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?
Well, that?s the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I?ll be in Cuba.
All right, look, look, you?ve got to do this yourself, okay in person.
At least you know her name.
You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.
What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
Where in Cuba?
Hey.
You uh, you may have been right about Jill.
Oh! I knew it! What happened?
Umm, she kissed me.
What?! You kissed!
All right.
Okay, here you go.  I have two queens, what do you have?
A two and a five.
Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!
Really?!
Oh yeah! Okay, lets play again.  What do you got?
A four and a nine.
Youre kidding right?
No. Why?
Well thats a full cup!
Damn! I am good at Cups!
What? Why? Where are you?
Im still on the set!
Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!
I know! Im sorry! The guys drunk, they wont let me go until we get this.
Oh my God! Im gonna have to find another minister.
No! No, Im the minister! Alright, look-look, put em both on the phone, Ill marry them right now.
Ugh! Joey, I have to go.
Hey! Dont you hang up on me! Ill marry you and me right now! I have the power!
Oh hey Joey! What's up?
I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right?
Yeah, I've been around.
Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route?
Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees.
Great! Problem solved!
Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.
All right, first thing we gotta do, damage control.
Why?
Well, I think uhh, someone out there may have been bad mouthing you all over town.
Bastard!
You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping orOh!
All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp!
Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it.
Oh, I can't believe it!
I mean I think it's great!
For him.
She might be able to do better.
Hey guys!
Joey! Come here! Come here!
Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.
You mean how they're friends and nothing more?
No. Joey, she
Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
Yes, but y'know what?
It doesn't matter who knows what.
Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know!
Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.
Yknow, youre friends getting married, its gotta change things.
You really think it would be that different?
How could it not be?
I mean pretty soon theyre gonna be having kids, and then theyre just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids.
And then maybe theyre gonna have to leave the city to be near a
Well, things change.
I dont want them to move to a
Itll be okay Joe.
Its still there!
Mrs. Braverman must be out.
She could be out of town. Maybe shell be gone for months.
By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We dont want her to come back to bad cheesecake.
No that could kill her.
Well, we dont want that.
No, so were protecting her.
But we should take it.
But we should move quick.
Why?
Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?
Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.
Well, you're gonna.
I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...
Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?
Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women.
And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know?
Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...
Hey, you're not him.
You're you.
When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?
No.
No.
You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business.
Now that wasn't easy, but you did it!
And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I'm married."
You really think so?
Yeah. I really do.
Thanks, Chandler.
Get off!
Hi.
Your Fettuccini Alfredo looks a little dry, did you use all your cheese?
When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?
And the cream?
Cheese makes me thirsty.
Okay. Lets move on.
All right.
Oh! Something smells good over at Monicas station!  Oh my God! This is absolutely amazing! Youve never made this before?
Oh no!
I dont know anything about cooking.
I had to ask someone what its called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles.
Well, hats off to the chef.
I-I-Im sorry, your-your mouth was full, I didnt hear what you said. Umm, hats off to who now?
The chef!
Thats right.
Hey, Pheebs.
Hey.
How's it going?
Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.
So what's going on?
Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger.
I dunno, there's just something about...
Basically we just feel that he's...
We hate that guy.
Yeah. Hate him.
We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?
...No, we hate him.
We're sorry.
Hey!
Hey!
What are you doing?
Im sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.
Yes that was mine.
Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
Yes that would have made more sense.
Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man!
All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time.
And whatever you say, I'll believe ya.
Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?
Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?
Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.
She said what?
She said, "If Im not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it."
Postpone it?
Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding?
Do you my sisters teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh?
This isnt right.
I realize that people are going to be disappointed. But, Im sure theyll come back when we can do it right.
I cant ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?
Dont you point your pants at me!
We have no choice!
Anywhere thats half-decent wouldve be booked months ago, Ross dont you understand?
This is our wedding Im talking about.
The only thing I understand is postponing it is not an option. This is when were getting married.
So what are you saying? Its now or never?
No. Im saying its now.
Or?
Theres no or in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!
Its not the pants.
Its you that is backwards.
And if, and if you dont understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldnt get married at all!
No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please
Hi, honey.
See you later.
What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!
Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask!
Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. Im calling for Monica Geller.
Oh no!
I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if shes still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available
Oh please, he didnt hear it! He didnt hear it!!
This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!
NOOOO!!!!!!!!
Ma! What're you doing here?
I came to give you this  and this.
Oww! Big ring!
Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.
Do you uh, do you talk about me?
Yeah, yeah, all the time.
Really?
But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.
Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!
Have you ever seen so much crap?
Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap
Check this out. Can I have this?
What?
I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti.
All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office.
It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.
If it's not you, this is a horrible story.
Fortunately, it is me.
And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much.
Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate.
Y'know, someplace nice.
Yeah, someplace nice.
Yeah!
How much do you think I can get for my kidney?
So, what do you think?
I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
I know!
So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?
Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!
Heads up Ross!  Score!  You suck!
Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.
Gotcha.
This place is really my Grandmothers.
I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this.
So if the landlord ever asks, Im 87 year old woman, whos afraid of her VCR.
So are you thirsty?
Oh, you bet I am!
Okay, heres your penis!
Ohh, okay.
Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house.
Thank you, its my moms. So this is the kitchen.
Hey, ready for dinner?
Ooh, absolutely!
Great! How about you wanted to go the Italian place down on Bleaker Street right?
Ooh, I love that place!  So, no.
How about Mama Lisettie's?
Enh. Sure!
I wonder how long that milk  has been setting out.
Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy!
Thatthis milk is mine.
I bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know.
Okay, let's go!
Hey, buddy!  Are you familiar with Section 11-B of the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the
But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place.
Oh, so you're saying you'd choose convenience over health?!
Okay, stop!
Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy?
Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?
Well, I suppose I could give him a warning.
Thank you.
Go!
Go!
Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.
No! No! Phoebe, come on! I dont want to switch! Please come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!
No but at Monicas you can eat cookies over the sink!
I know. Im sorry.
All right fine! This looks like so much fun.
Yeah.
God, what a mess.
Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.
Well, I lost.
Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S.
Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.
Hey! Howd the interview go?
Oh, I blew it. I wouldnt of even hired me.
Oh, come here sweetie, listen, youre gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job.
Thats not how that was supposed to come out.
This is the worst Christmas ever.
Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house.
I cant!
Its too late!
Terry already hired that girl over there.
Look at her, shes even got waitress experience.
Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin....  swans.
That word was swans.
What do we got there?
A piece of something: boxer shorts, greeting cards, and what looks like a half-charred pictureWow, that guy's hairier than the Chief!
You know, it's a really funny story how this happened.
It's all right.
It's all right.
You don't have to explain.
This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control.
You're our third call tonight.
Really?
Oh, sure, Valentine's is our busiest night of the year.
I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down.
No, you were right. I don't have a plan.
Thank God. Food.
Phoebe?
What?
Do you have a plan?
I don't even have a 'pl'.
No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.
Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?'
Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?
Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?
And-and a power tie?
Oh God.

Big Bird's friend.

Pheebs? What, why are you whispering?
I ate a bug.
Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a penny. Lets stock up.
Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we dont know where we are, so we cant get a tow truck.
Oh, now you want a favour?
Yes, please.
Well, oh, Im sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but Im a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?
Phoebe, hang on a second.  Here, take my car, go pick up your friends.
No, Im not gonna pick them up.
Listen, we both know youre gonna do it cause youre not a jerk.
So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car.
No, Rachel doesnt want me to....
Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you cause she fell in love with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but dont punish your friends for what Rachel did to you.
Yeah, youre right.
God, I feel so guilty about Ross.
Oh, I know.
I kinda feel like it's my fault.
Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.
Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out!
Well, I think it's very brave what you said.
All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places.
Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?
Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice.
Okay, I admit it!
I love this coat!
Okay, Iit's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley!
Remember Phil Huntley?

Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the
I'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir.
Is this because of the burrito thing?
You need to give him money.
Give him money? It was a joke!
No, to get a table! Places like this are always shakin you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.
Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.
You've got to be smooth about it.
Hey, I can be smooth.
Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it.
Of course, sir.
Okay.
Id better get back to my desk.
Okay, you hard worker! Ill remember to put that in your evaluation.
My what?
Well, youve been here for two months now and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation.
But yknow, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate.
Are you serious?
No, Ive just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up?
I can blow dry it.
I can put gel on it.
It doesnt matter, I still wind up with this little  cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head.
Its so annoying.
Does it bug you?
You bug me.
Is there any chance you didnt see that?
Hey Joey, what cha doing?

Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!
Okay, look Im sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldnt have, but you got porn!
Hey-hey, yknow what?
Theres nothing wrong with a woman enjoying a littleerotica.
Its just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand.
You got porn!
Well, I feel like a snack!
Do you want some shortbread? Eh thats Scottish like you are.
Oh no thanks. I dont like
What?!
Well its just my entire family was run out of Scotland byVikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.

You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!
How did you know about that?!
Hi!
Hi!
Come in.
Thanks for comin back, umm, okay there have been a lot of people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and

No, I did, but tell me again, because its so romantic.
Well youre whippin so slow! Cant you do it any faster?
Joey!
Come on!
I dont wanna make any mistakes, alright?
This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?
So why dont you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?
Oh I am!
Ross, if you dont tell them, then I will!
Okay, fine!
Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?
Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No it cant? Okay.
You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?
Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.
Okay, now you're even cuter!!
Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.
What?
The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me.
What are you talking about?
I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
That's not possible!
Ow!
I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.
Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough.
I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.
No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!
This bicep?
Well it's not flexed right now!
It's Phoebe.
Umm, well I sorta have some bad news, can I come in?
Umm, well, umm Grandma died.
No, she just died today! Okay, umm, we're having a memorial service tomorrow.
No you didn't!
Well, lots of people! Look, are you coming to memorial service or not?
Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert.
anyway, his name is Allan and weve been going out for three years.
He was my first client when I became a party planner.
He was planning a party for his girlfriend at the time.
Oh well.
And he was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse.
Oh. Oh, thats great!
Really? Like how?
Well yknow, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh, wed jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so theyd put salt on their cereal.
Thats a good one.
Yeah? You like that one?
Yeah, youre funny.
Im funny?
Oh thank God!
Well hey, Ive got a ton of these!
Umm, oh hereDo you want a good one?
Umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge.
Right?
And then you say to person, I bet you cant roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face.
And then when they do it, theyre left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face.
Can I do it to you?
Yeah, I-I-I-Im funny Ben, but Im not stupid. Okay?
Chloe? Hi..
Is this about me taking your watch?
You took my watch?
Im sorry, I do that.
Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?
Oh no. I feel it isnt really anybodys business, y'know.
Oh, one other thing. Hoshi thinks that you being ringside may have affected my concentration.
Yeah. That-that was the problem.
Excuse me, Doug?  Hey there sports fan!!
Bing! You got those numbers for me?
So you still in touch with anyone from high school?
Umm. Well, theres Rachel, and umm, I think thats it. How bout you?
Oh yeah, I still hang with Simmons and Zana, y'know.
I see Spindler a lot.
Devane, Kelly, and I run into Goldie from time to time.
Stick, Brown, Sulkov, McGuire, J.T., Beardsley.
Is that all?
Ehh, y'know after high school, you just kinda lose touch. Oh yeah! I ran into Richard Dorfman.
Ohh, how is he?
Not so good, Simmons and I gave him a wedgie.
Isnt he an architect now?
Yeah, they still wear underwear.
So the Porsche guy took his car back.
But you found the keys to his clothes?
No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.
And people will think you own a Porsche because youre wearing the clothes?
Hey, Mon, I was just doing the dishes!
Hey!
Oh! Its you.  Hi.
What about me?! You-you just said I could!
Im not even getting married! Okay, this is a question for science fiction writers!
I cant believe youre not picking me.
Hey, how can it
Im not even Im not even
Fine, yknow what, thats it. From now on, Joey, I want you to be my best man.
Yes!  Shame about you man.
Hey-hey! Stanley! Hey-hey! You're leading man is here! Let's get to work.
Umm, slight change of plans. We've shut down.
Wh-what?! Why?!
It's a money thing, we don't have any.
You're kidding right?
No.
What?!
It-it's probably just temporary. We're hoping to get some more money soon, so if could just uh, hang out.
Uh, hang out?! How long?
I don't know.
A week?
Maybe two?
The money will turn up!
People will always wanna invest in movies!
Hey, you're not rich are ya?
No!
Eh, worth a shot.  Look Joey, let me know where you're staying, okay?
Hey pal, are you Joey Tribbiani?
Yeah.
These got left for ya.
Thanks.   Congratulations on your big break.
Rachel, do you have any muffins left?
Yeah, I forget which ones.
Oh, you're busy, that's ok, I'll get it. Anybody else want one?
Hey.
Hey!
So how was Joan?
I broke up with her.
Dont tell me, because of the big nostril thing?
They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.
Come on, they were not that huge.
I'm tellin' you, she leaned back; I could see her brain.
How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?
Hold it, hold it.
I gotta side with Chandler on this one.
When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple.
It made me nuts.
You or me?
I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.
You guys are messing with me, right?
Yeah.
That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, "whoa."
