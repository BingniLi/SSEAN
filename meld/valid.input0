Oh my God, hes lost it. Hes totally lost it.

Or! Or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at the source.
Youre a genius!
Aww, man, now we wont be bank buddies!
Now, theres two reasons.
Hey.
Hey!
Ohh, you guys, remember that cute client I told you about? I bit him.
Where?!
On the touchy.
And
No, I know!
I-Im sorry, but the moment I touch him, I just wanna throw out my old oath and take a new, dirty one.
Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract yourself.
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Like-like when Im doing something exciting and I dont wanna get
Thank you, Joey.

Yeah, we werewe were just looking around.
Oh-oh, youre-youre fellow scholars.

Perhaps,  perhaps Dr. Chester Stocks musings on the Smiledon Californicus?
Uhh.
Ah AhGet out of here!  Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marions views on evolution?
Uh, actually I find Marions views far too progressionist.
I find Marions views far too progressionist.
Im sorry, who are you?
Im a professor here uh, RossGeller.
Ross Geller, why do I know that name? Its uhWait!  Did you write this?
Yes! Youre the person who checked out my book?!
Yknow, you look nothing like I wouldve thought. Youreyoure so young.
Well I uh, I skipped forth grade.
You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
What?
I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?
The point is I...
I don't need this right now, OK.
It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy.
This ship has sailed.
Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.
Fine.
Cause I don't need your stupid ship.
Good.
Good.
Oh, it's so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon.
Yknow, Monica and Chandler are married. Ross and Rachel are having a baby. Maybe you and I should do something.
All in good time my love.
All in good time.
Oh shoot!
I left my guitar in their apartment.
Well you can let me in later.
I dont have a key, they took mine to give to you.
What?! They took mine to give to you!
Why would they take away our keys?
Wow! It looks like we got a lot of good stuff.
Oh we did, but my mom got us the greatest gift of all.
A
No. Shes going to live with us for eight weeks.
Uh, what?
Yes! Shes gonna help us take care of the baby! Woo-hoo.
WhatYoure not serious.
I mean shes a very nice woman, but there is no way we can take eight weeks of her.
Shell drive us totally crazy.
Hi Ross!
Hi roomie!
Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?
I dont know!
Its not like its porn!
This is a serious, legitimate movie.
And the nudity is really important to the story.
Thats what you say about porn.
Youre right. Maybe I shouldnt even go on the call back.
No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean, the chance to star in a movie? Come on!
Well thats true.
And I am only naked in one scene.
Plus it sounds really great.
My characters catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl.
Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm.
So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other.
Its really sweet and-and tender.
Hey, whats up?
Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.
But youre still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today.
"Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." Nice!
Yeah?
I just figured yknow, after living with you itd be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, yknow?
Someone I can learn from, someone-someone whos different than me.
And whats more different than me. A guy whos
So where are we going next?
This witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise him coming home.
Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?
Come on man!  Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up?
It's a witness not a perp. And no one talks like that!
Yeah, no one talks like that!
Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop!
Hey, I'm more cop than you two!
How do you figure that?
Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!
I guess so.
Here you go. Thank you!
Wait, Rach! Where's the other one?
Oh what, you-you want both of them?
Rachel Karen Green, where's the other earring?!
Okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but I kinda lost it.
I know it's in the apartment, but I
Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!
Tell her to wear her own earrings.
These
Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings?! I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff!
Why not?
Because I lose her stuff!
Uh Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
Yeah!
Whats going on?
Chandlers gone again!
Oh my God! Why would you play hide and seek with someone you know is a flight risk?!
Okay. You ready to push again?
I already had a baby. Leave me alone.
Okay, okay, come on, you can do it. You can do it!
Yeah!!
Little Leslie is here!
We got another one!
Oh my God, I can't believe I have two-two children.
How scary is that?
Come on little Chandler, it's time to be born. Come on little Chandler! Come on!
All right, he's coming. He's coming!
Hey, where's his thing?
Chandler's a girl!
Oh God, kindergarten flashback.
They musta read the sonogram wrong.
Cause they, 'cause they thought it was a boy, but Chandler's a girl!
Chandler's a girl!
Okay, keep saying it!
Am I too late?!
No-no ah, everything's okay. Everybody's healthy there's 30 fingers and 30 toes.
We have our babies?
Yeah.
Oh, we have our babies.
Hey Toby!
Hey Bobby.
Its Bob actually. Hey, you work up here, can you tell me where this Chandler
Uhh yeah. Yeah, its  right, right down there.  Right there, yeah. Can I ask you why?
I want to talk to that bastard, see what his problem is.
Okay Bob listen uhh, Im the reason you didnt get the job up here.
Toby dont.
Bob!
Toby! Im not gonna let you cover for him. Anything you say right now will just get me more upset with Chandler!
Thank you.  Oh Joey and look at this crib! Its so cute!
I know! I found it on the street.
Are you seriousReally?! Its in such good condition.
Yeah.
Wow! Whoa-whoa whats under the covers?
I dont know.
Its moving.
Ew.
Its stillIts got a tail! Get it out of here! Get it out of here!!
Ooh! Ah! Okay!
Well, I went over to Kyles last night to pick up a few things and we got to reminiscing
we talked through most of the night and we realized that the reason we were so angry at each other was because there are still feelings there. So
Oh just say it Kyle!
Were gonna give it another try.
What about her whining and her constant need for attention?!
Im gonna work on that.
Oh right, because youre so capable of change.
Yknow, he hums when he pees!
I do know.
It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.
Were so sorry.
Thats all right, we-we dont need you. In fact, hey Im over it already.
Yeah, and yknow what? I dont give a tiny rats ass.
Yeah, were gonna go.
Im sorry. Ugh, Pheebs, you were, you were right about her. Yknow, she
Oh. Yknow, he hums while he does other stuff to.
Yeah, we're better off without them.
And yknow, even if they break up again, youd better not let him in your sad mens club!
Divorced mens club.
Why isnt that valet back with my Porsche?
Maybe because youve got the keys?
This is totally your fault!
My fault?! You threatened the judge!
Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporters machine!!
Phoebe!
Yeah?
Have you seen Chandler?!
No! Why?
The woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation and that we could move up our wedding and Chandler heard!
I know!
How bad is this?
Well for the regular guy, its bad, but Chandler, Oh dear God!
I know! I know! And he totally freaked out and I cant find him anywhere!
What are you gonna do?
Well, Im never gonna listen to you again, thats for sure!
"Yknow, harm can it do if you go and put your name down?"
Rachel said that!
Well Rachels not here!
Come on, come on.
Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit.
This is all your fault.
This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know?
My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you.
The woman I love is having a baby today. I've been waiting for this just as much as you have.
No no no, believe me.
No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok?
And you know what the funny thing is?
When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok?
Where does that leave me?
You get to be the baby's father.
Everyone knows who you are.
Who am I?
There's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's no... Lesbian Lover Day.
Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.
This is so great.
You wanna explain that?
I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one.
And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most.
And it's not even born yet.
It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world.
I'm sorry, you were fighting.
Okay, it's a typical New York City apartment. Two girls are just hanging out.
Hi, how are you doing Kelly?
I'm doing just fine! God, Tiffany, you smell so great!
It's my new perfume. Why don't you come closer where you can
Oh, y'know Joey, you are sick!
This is disgusting!
I'm not reading this!
What?! Wait-wait-wait! The handsome man was about to enter!!
All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser.
I mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat...
You know he's gay?
I just wanna clarify this: are you outing Mr. Peanut?
Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody.
Hi. Hi.
What are you doing here?
Well, what?
What?
What is it?
That she left you?
That she likes women?
That she left you for another woman that likes women?
Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you...
Then what?
My first time with Carol was...
What?
It was my
With Carol?  Oh.
So in your whole life, you've only been with oneoh.
Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight!
Hi. Where is everybody?
Oh, its already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is wrong?
My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over.
Oh no! Why?
Cause Carols a lesbian.  And, and Im not one. And apparently its not a mix and match situation.
Oh my God! I dont believe it! Oh, you poor bunny.
Im an idiot.
I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and Id be out and shed, shed see some beautiful woman, and, and shed be Ross y'know look at her, and Id think, God, my wife is cool!
Aw! Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?
Well, now I do!!
Im sorry.
Seven years.
I mean weve been together seven years, shes the only woman whos ever loved me, and the only woman Ive-Ive ever....
Aw, God Ross. Oh.
Ill do it.
No you wont.
Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe him, hes sorry.
But,  youve got one more apology to make, all right, youve got to apologize to Mary-Angela.
Okay, absolutely!
All right.
Youve got it.
Cookie, now you can punch him!
What?!
All right, that's it, I quit.
What? I didn't say anything.
Yeah, but this  isn't the face of a person who trusts a person.
Ok, this  is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.
Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.
Julie.
What?!
Jody!
You were with Julie?
Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend.
And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping.
Oh. Oh my God.
Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me.
Yeah, right. Sure!
Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time.
Look, I'm sorry, all right.
I never meant for you to find out!
Oh, please, you wanted to get caught.
That is not true!
Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?
Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?
Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to
Yeah!
I cant say.
Why?!
Why not?
I cant say because hes famous.
Oh my God, who is it?!
Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us.
Okay, okay. Its James Brolin. James Brolin is the father of my baby.
As in Barbara Streisands husband James Brolin?
What?! Well he never said that to me!
In
Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse.
Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don't have any past life memories.
Of course you don't sweetie. You're brand new.
I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.
Oh, let's not tell this story.
Oh, come on!
Oh no, I know! I know! It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck on his head!
What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?!
Hey, it's not like it sounds.
It's
Wendy, we had a deal!  Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!
Who was that?
Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.
Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye.
Ten dollars an hour.
No.
Twelve dollars an hour.
Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around.
You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you.
I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you...  twenty dollars an hour.
Done.
The reactors gonna blow in three seconds, were never gonna make it!
Youve got to get out of here! Save yourself!
No! I wont leave you!
Dont worry about me, Im a robot! Im just a machine!!
No youre not! Not to me!
Oh my God.
What?
I am
Yeah, youre great! Okay, lets take it from
No, I mean I was really acting my ass off.
Yeah, I thought I was pretty good too.
Oh yeah, youre solid. Yeah, youre just no me.
Yknow what? I think thats enough for now. Yeah. I dont want to be over rehearsed.
Fine!
Ill do it without you!
I dont need you or anybody else!
Im gonna make it on my own!
Youll see!!
Youll
I can't believe that Ross is gone. It is just so sad.
I didn't know Ross and you were so close.
We weren't but we had one class together. He was such a great    guy and he talked so passionately about science. I always remembered him.
I'm sure that would mean a lot to him.
And if heaven has a    door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.
I thought so many times about calling him and asking him out.    I guess I really missed my chance.
But you didn't!
I'm still alive!!
Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you.
It's a long story but the things    you just said really made my day!
I mean, the fact that you are here means more    to me than if this room were filled with people!
You sick freak, who does that? I can't believe I had a crush on    you!
Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!!
Well do a quick check.
Okay.
So, eight days late huh?
Yeah.
You must be a little uncomfortable.
Eh, just a tad.
Youre about 80 percent effaced, so youre on your way.
It still could last a little while longer.
If youre anxious there are a few ways to help things along.
Do them!!
Actually, theyre things you can do. Just some home remedies, but in my experience Ive found that some of them are quite effective.
Well, we are ready to try anything.
Okay, theres an herbal tea you can drink.
Okay.
What is wrong with Emma?
Oh she misunderstood, she thought she was moving to Tulsa.
Anytime you're ready.
Ok, ok, here we go.
Ok, where am I talking to, here?
I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but...
Just aim for the bump.
Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes.
You know, I, you know, can't do this.
Uh, this is too weird.
I feel stupid.
So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan does it.
Hello, baby. Hello, hello.
Oh, hi. Its Mark.
Easy. Easy. You have to go to the hospital. Okay?
Okay, I do.
Okay.
I really do.
Okay, Im gonna get your coat and then Ill-Ill put you in a cab.
Okay. Oh wait, wait-wait, youre not gonna come with me?
Of course I am. I just have to make a call.
Okay.
Okay?
Thank you.  Oww!!!! God!
What?! I wh-, whats wrong?
Im sorry, I just cant go to the hospital lookin like this.
Pete Becker is circling the ring now. It looks like, hes just trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is just...
Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!
Oh, I cant watch this.
Check it out, hes winning!  Petes winning!
Really?!
No-o-o!!
Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his favourite area.
Oh! Oh!
Wait, if thats his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?
Well, this is ironic.
Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didnt want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete cant.
Dude, you dont have to brag! We got nothing here!!
Should we tell Rachel theres an empty private room right next door to hers?
We could, or we can have sex in it.
Well let me think about that, while I remove my pants!
I thought I was a complete idiot.
Hey, Im with you. He even asked me if I thought youd go out with him.
Oh! Oh, I think Im gonna throw up a little bit. What did you say?
I said no.
What?!
What? II just figured since youre pregnant youre not gonna be seeing people.
Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not people. Second of all, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant?
I didnt tell him. I didnt know if you were telling people. This is back when I thought Kash was still people.
Good-good, dont tell him. Dont tell him. Just have him call me okay?
Rach look, I really dont think thats such a great
Okay, you go do it! Ill come back to that set! Ill meet more actors! Ill meet em all!
Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshuas gone so you and Emily are free to go.
Thats okay.
Shes still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, its too late to do any of the things I had planned, so
Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket!
You tell them to wait!
Okay. Wait! Wait!
Emily.
Oh no-no-no! Oh-no!  No! No! Emily!
Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay?
Okay.
I know. You're the guy who wouldn't chip in for the handyman.
Nevermind!
No, I-I actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted. I mean you had just moved in.
Jen.
Jen, I know this may sound a little But uh, would you maybe wanna grab a cup of coffee sometime, or
Sure! That would be nice.
Umm?
Oh! My number is on there.  Give me a call.
I will give you a call.
I'll see you later.
Okay!
I forgot my paper.
Here we go. Okay, brace yourselves.
What?
Okay.
Ow!
Arent you gonna go?
No. Thank you.
No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms.
Well, they never have any paper in there y'know. So my rule is no tissue, no tuschy.  Well, if everybodys going.
No, y'know what dont close it  cause the... keys...are in there.
Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!
Whats going on?
My lighters in there!
I promise.
Although, dont feel like you cant visit.
Hey, is, is, is Chandler here?
No, no hes not.
You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.
What?  So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler?
Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not.
Joey, you cant keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him.
Itll kill him. I mean itll, itll just kill him.
Well, you could wait til I go to the dentist, maybe
Hey, what are you doing here?
Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of
Ah yeah, but now its Susan and me in Mexico and the hostages coming home.
Wheres Ben?
Hes sleeping.
Ahh.  Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?
Umm, yeah, actually, Susans gonna be home any minute, its kinda an anniversary.
Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January?
Its not that kind of anniversary.
Ah!  Oh.
Sooo!! Anyway...
Where are we gonna find a tiny little hat?
Oh, oh, oh, Ill get Rainy Day Bear!!
Because hell know what to do?  Oh my God, youre a genius!
Oh God, oh God, its sowed on though.
Give it. Give it.
Okay.
Oh!!
Oh, its just like a bloodbath in here today.
Please. This is so your fault.
How, how is this my fault?
Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along.
Yeah? Well, there's a lot of things Carol never did before I came along.
Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it!
Get in here.
Come on.
My god, you guys, I don't believe you.
There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing.
So just stop all the yelling, just stop it!
Yeah, Susan.
Don't make me do this again, I don't like my voice like this.
Ok, who wants to hear something ironic?
Oh! Here it is!  Ooh, Joey! Why did you sign it, "Son of a bitch?"
I didnt do that! Who wouldve done that?!
Son of a bitch!
Okay, maybe ask this guy.
Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project.
Yknow sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, arent they?
Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Yknow? The only problem is, Carls acting is
The
Yeah, hes the reason I didnt get that big
Hey, uh can I get a little piece of that cake?
Pizza!! We like Pizza!! Get out!!!
Hey Monica, theres a customer who wants to complement the chef, should I let him in?
Sure, I love this part!
Come on in.
Really? In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment.
In the moment, yeah.
But only in the moment. So do ya wanna kiss again?
Sure, New Years Eve is only two weeks away. Can you wait?
No.
Me neither.
3, 2,
Joey, you dont have to count down every time we kiss.
Uh, yeah, okay. Except I sorta felt like I needed a couple of seconds to get ready.
Alright. Phoebe?
Okay, okay.
If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs!
Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you?
Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever.
See, there's always one guy.  "If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes."
Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy.
Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?
Probably kill myself!
..Excuse me?
Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live!
Joey, uh-
You
Im sorry.
Joey, onstage!
Well can you at least stay to the end of the play?
I mean, Ill go to the airport with ya, I-I wanna say good bye.
Where are you Vic?
Flights in an hour. I-I gotta go.
Vic! Vic!
In a minute!!
So this is it? Victor?
Yeah, I guess it is.
Listen, I ah, I gotta say good bye, and-and I gotta say it quick cause this is killing me.
One thing you gotta know, is that I will never forget you.
But, youve got things you have to do now, and so do I.
And so Im gonna get on this spaceship,  and Im gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels.
But when I return, 200 years from now, youll be long gone.
But I wont have aged at all.
So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne, baby, Im gonna want to meet her.
So long, Vic!
Nooo Way! The most romantic song ever is
See, I-I think that one that Elton John wrote for, um, that guy on
What song was that, Pheebs?
Hi Monica!
Hey Mon!
Hey Mon!
Oh my God, has she slept at all?
Nope.
No, it's been three nights in a row.
Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of Richard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so.
Oh, okay that explains it.
I got a call at two in the morning, but all I could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a opossum.
But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the phone call.
So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?
Yknow what, I dont know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.
Yeah, I know but
Oh no-no-no, Im there.
Hey!
Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?
You made pancakes?
Yep! Grab a plate.
No-no, stay right there.  Gettin closer.
Okay, okay, but dont worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles,
Listen also were uh, were watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over.
Oh yeah!
Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.
Yeah, hero sandwiches.
Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war in any way.
When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you all.
Not you Joey.
Oh my good God.
Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3, macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs.
Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now.
I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape you made me.
Oh, the mixed tape.
The Way You Look Tonight
You are just the sweetest.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, guess what Im doing tonight.
What?
Im checking out the restaurant with Pete.
Ohh, Monica, I am so excited for you.
So honey this uh, this threesome thing umm, I mean how-how are you gonna start to find
Ooh, actually Ive been making a list of all the women I know who might be into doing this!
Oh.  Wow!  Huh.  Boy!  Well, someones been doing their homework.
Yeah. Ooh, and I know Gail Rosten is in there twice, but she is so
Oh, I know.  Yknow, just-just talking about it is getting me kinda
Oh, me too.
and then, we couldve gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar!
Ross, it just wouldnt have been feasible.
But having a dove place the ring on your finger wouldve been no problem?
It was really fun being married to you tonight.
Yeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 bucks Ive ever made.
Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something?
Yeah.
That proposal, at the planetarium
I know, I know it was stupid.
Are you kidding?!
With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the stars!
It wasreally wonderful!
Did you just make that up?
No, actually I thought about it when, when we were going out.
Its how I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me.
Well, that wouldve been very hard to say no too.
Its a good thing I didnt do it, because it sounds like it wouldve been a very expensive wedding.  Okay, good night
Goodnight
Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldnt get messed up?
I will think about it.

Although, I might need some convincing.
Well, I, umm
Kidding! God, I feel wild today!
Oh my God! Chandler just left though!
Yeah but, maybe its not what we think. Maybe its tell Monica Im sorry Idrank the last of the milk.
Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that hes changed his name, yknow? Tell Monica Im sorry.
I think it means he freaked out and left!
Dont be so negative! Good God! Isnt it possible that Sorry is sitting in there  right now?!
Okay. Phoebe, I-I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do?

Anyway, theres this big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren bought a table, so I kinda have to go
Whats the charity?
I dont know, something either trees or diseaseRalph mumbles a lot.
Does Ralph mumble when youre not paying attention?
Yeah! Its weird. But the thing is need to find a date.

Hey!
What are you guys doing later?
Oh, Rachel and I have appointments to get our hair cut.

Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.
Okay.
Ah, I-I never should have said what I said.
Ityknow what?
It just doesn't matter how I feel.
I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay?
Um, I'm not.
Oh, god, I knew it, that I freaked you out.
No, you didn't. The only thing that freaked me out was you saying that nothing could ever happen between us.
Really?
Yeah, so, please don't fire me for doing this.
Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not laughing now, are ya pal!
See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.

You do?
Yeah, and to save you from any embarrassment umm, I think maybe I should talk first.
Okay.
Okay.  Uh, Ross and Rachel. Rachel and Ross. Thats been one heck of a see-saw hasnt it?
What?
I mean look, that-that one night we had was fun andand certainly passionate, but dont you think its better if we just stayed friends?
Seriously. What?!
Okay.
Okay.
Yknow what?
If you want to, we can do it one more time.
I mean Id-Id be okay with that.
In fact, I have some time right now.
Okay, yknow what? Can I, can I talk now?
Oh sure.
Im pregnant.  Ross?  Ross?  Okay, whenever youre ready.  And youre the father by the waybut you got that

Okay.
Okay.
Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman.
Hmph.
And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her.
And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place....
With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa!
I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head.
And your like 'Mom, get outta here!'
You know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing.
So it's kinda like, you're, you know.
You know.... You don't know!
Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is the matter with you?
You said...
I said '
Oh!

I just cant decide who she looks more alike, you or Rachel?
Oh what are you kidding? Shes gorgeous, its all Rachel.
Im sorry, for the last time, why arent you two together again?
No, I know.
I know, because youre not in that place.
Which would be fine, except you totally are.
Itsits complicated okay?
Yeah thats true. Yeah, you love her. You always have. You have a child together. There is no right answer.
Look, weve been together.
Okay?
And then apart, and then together, and then apart, and now we have a baby.
Its just if-if we got together again and it didnt work outI could never do that to Emma.
I mean she-she thinking everything Oh thatsnow me.
What do they put something in the water in this place?
Since Rachel and I were doing really, were doing really well right now.
I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more you might wreck it.
Yeah, exactly.
Right.  Or you might get everything youve wanted since you were fifteen.

Besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need    to keep your tadpoles in the tank.
We really need to take those tests?
Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year.
I think    it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. Just a few routine tests.
But I don't wanna do it in a cup!
Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?
No. Have you seen David?
No, no, he hasn't been around.
Well, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk.

Theres a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor.
Excuse me.

Wow!

The actor who has the part doesnt know he might be fired.
Its the lead in a series, Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
Im the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!
Oh good God! If you want a baby so bad just go steal it!
What is going on with you? Since when are you so crazy about babies?
Im not crazy about babies. Im crazy about us.
What?
Look, weve always talked about having babies someday.
Im not saying it has to be right now, but Im starting to think that we can handle it.
Were good.
Were really good.
Oh, did you catch him?!
Wh-what did he say?!
He said, "Nice to meet you Glenda."  Well, obviously I couldn't give him my real name?
Why?! Why not?!
Come on, you saw the way he ran out of here!
He's gonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned!
What did you say to him?
Well, I said, I told him y'know, that I was the executor person of Francis' will and that I needed to talk to him so I'm gonna meet him at the coffee house later.
Oh yeah, sure.
Okay, in about ten seconds youre gonna see him kiss me.
And in about five seconds youre gonna see why.
Ross did I ever tell you about the time that I went backpacking through Western Europe?
Okay, get ready to see some beggin!
Oh, you came on to Ross!
What?!
Now Im so happy.
What are you talking about?!
You used the Europe story!
Thats the magic story you use when you wanna have sex!
How do you know about that story?!

I heard it from my friend Irene who heard it from some guy!
Some guy!!
No. No, she told me his name was Ken Adams.
Ken Adams!!
How we doing, you guys ready?
Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?
Some days it's all I can think about.
Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings.
Oh... ok, fine.
But... ehm...
I just have one question for you,    ehm...
When we exit should we walk, or run, or prance,    or stroll...
Stop it, stop it! He talks slow but he might pee fast! Ok,    let's go!!
I cant believe this! How long as this been going on?
Well umm, Alexandra has been
Oh, it has a name?
Phoebe, dont get upset!
OkayOop! Too late! Im leaving! Come on Chandler lets go!
Well, Phoebe I thought IdYeah, what the hell.
Ben!
Oh, that's good. Maybe he'll hear you and pull the cord.
Stop the bus! Wait! Wait! Wait!
Are you sure he didn't break it because it really hurts?
No, it's just a good bone bruise. And, right here  is the puncture wound from your ring.
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry!
I got my s's back!
Which we can celebrate later.
Celebrate.
Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye.
Rachel, how did this happen?
I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night.
Where?
At his apartment. Is this juice?
Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?
Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser.
I licked my arm, what?
It's breast milk.
So?
Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person.
What is the big deal?
What did you just do?
Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?
You won't even taste it?
No!
Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?
Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
Aww!
Hey Pheebs, could you please not put your feet up on my newold sheet?
Oh sure!  Noo!
Ohh!!
My apothecary table!!!
What?!
Noooooo!!
Ross, where did you get this?!
Oh my God, Phoebe,
Wow! Oh my God, well if theyve ripped off our table ours must be much more than one and fifty dollars!
Well this doesnt even smell like opium.
Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! And thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way.
How is she?
It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign.
How's the hair?
I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good.
I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.
Can we see her?
Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don't you come on in.
How're you doing?
Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.
Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it.
That would be no.
Come on. It doesn't taste bad.
Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh...
Cantaloupe juice.
Exactly.
You've tasted it? You've tasted it.
Uh huh.
Oh, you've tasted it.
You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true.
Gimme the bottle.  Gimme the towel.
I still don't get why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number.
Yknow, if they knew what they were doing they probably didnt give you real names either.
Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they dont give out fake names.
Oh yeah?  Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you.
Regina Philange.
I still dont get it, we didnt do anything wrong.
I know! Although, you did tell an awful lot of jokes.
I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!
Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah!
Well maybe it was all of your questions.
What about my questions?
No, Im sorry. Its just my foot itches like crazy.
Oh, Ill get it.
Wow! I usually get to know a girl a little better before I let her spoon me.
Relax, its not like were forking.
Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpapers a little faded, thats okay. Carpets a little loose. Hardwood floors!!
Hey!
Hello.
Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! Its so beautiful.
I know!!!
So, Im here, ready to play.
Okay.
I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. Ha-ha.
Whats this?
Thats a dog, every house should have a dog.
Not one that can pee on the roof.
Well, maybe its so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.
And is this in case the house sneezes?
No, no, thats the ghost for the attic.
I dont want a ghost.
Well, nobody wants a ghost. But youve got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.
Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground? That would never happen.
Okay, obviously you dont know much about the U.S. government.
Hey!
Hello.
I need to talk to you!
Sure, whats up?
All right, I just got changed in thirty seconds so you can be alone with him. You'd better go for it.
Please, I'm not going for anything.
Well, if you don't, I will.
Would you please go?
I would!
Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?!
Uh-huh.
Watch, watch.
Ooohhhh!!
And, and!
Ahhhh!!
Hey, my Fathers house does that!
O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything.
Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and theres nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening.
Okay. Its Emma.
Emma!  See? I dont want it.
Take it.
What?
Its clearly an Emma.
Oh honey, but you love that name.
Yeah, but I love you more.
Besides yknow, nothing goes with Bing.
So Im screwed.
Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, "Quack, quack!" Im happy all the time!
Nice try.
Wait, wait, wait!
Look, Monica
Look!
This is not going to work.
I bet this will work!
You are so great! I love you!
What?
Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I just stopped talking!
You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
No I didn't!
Yes, you did!
No I didn't!
You love me!
No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Hello Greg?
Hi, this is Monica from the plane?

The week after that?
Yknow what Greg?
We are good, interesting, funny people with
Hey Chandler! Yknow that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director?
Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class.
Whats a Movement class?
Its Chandlers way of pretending he didnt take mime.
Oh well listen, anyway shes directing the new Al Pacino movie. You gotta get me an audition!
Oh, I dont know man. I havent talked to her in like ten years.
I am.
Joey, what are you talking about? Youre a terrific actor.
You really think so?
Ugh, how can you even ask that question?!
Ross! Get a shot of this. (He's carrying an issue of the
Oh, okay, I'm having another one!
This one doesn't hurt eitherOoh, yes it does!
Ow!

Ooh!
Oh, I was kinda hoping that was it.
Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?
Yeah, I love you. Okay, bye!  Hi!
Hi!
That was Alice's mom, she said she left five hours ago. She should be here by now!
Oh, honey, dont worry. She's gonna make it on time.
Yeah.
I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.
But sadly I could not be enticed.
Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?!
I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.
Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not.
Eh?
All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket.
I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs.
Ohh, okay, they gave you the old time pricing.
Yeah.
Well, what period is it from?
Uh, its from yore. Like the days of yore. Yknow?
Yes, yes I do.
God, oh its just perfect!
I bet it has a great story behind it too.
Did they tell you anything?
Yes! That I know, this is from White Plains.
White Plains. Oh, it sounds like such a magical place.
So, you still dont think Im boyfriend material?
Huh?
I saw you checking me out during the game last night.
I, umm, shut up!
Good-bye Phoebe and Ursula. Ill miss you. P.S. Your Mom lives in Montauk. You just wrote this!
Well, its pretty much the gist. Well, except for the poem. You read the poem, right?
Noooo!!
All right, hang on!
Rachel, its going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here.
But I
No-no, wait!
Just let me finish, okay?
This isnt something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want.
And it
It is? Really?
Yeah, sweetie.
I mean were not, were not gonna live together anymore?
No.
What? Oh my God! Im gonna miss you so much!
Im gonna miss you!
I mean its the end of an era!
I know!
